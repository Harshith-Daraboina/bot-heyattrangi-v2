It is not a diagnostic tool and should not replace professional evaluation. -------------------------------------------------- ATTENTION-DEFICIT / HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD) -------------------------------------------------- ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. CORE SYMPTOM DOMAINS: 1. Inattention: - Difficulty sustaining attention - Careless mistakes - Difficulty organizing tasks - Forgetfulness - Easily distracted 2. Hyperactivity / Impulsivity: - Excessive movement or fidgeting - Difficulty remaining seated - Talking excessively - Interrupting others - Difficulty waiting turn DSM-5-TR CRITERIA SUMMARY: - Several symptoms must be present before age 12 - Symptoms must be present in two or more settings (e.g., home and school/work) - Symptoms must cause clear functional impairment - Symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder SUBTYPES: - Predominantly Inattentive Presentation - Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation - Combined Presentation -------------------------------------------------- ANXIETY DISORDERS (GENERALIZED ANXIETY FOCUS) -------------------------------------------------- Anxiety disorders involve excessive fear, worry, or avoidance behaviors that are disproportionate to actual threat and interfere with daily functioning. GENERALIZED ANXIETY FEATURES: - Excessive worry occurring more days than not - Difficulty controlling worry - Associated symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance - Worry is persistent and difficult to dismiss IMPAIRMENT: - Anxiety must cause distress or interfere with social, occupational, or daily functioning -------------------------------------------------- DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS -------------------------------------------------- Depressive disorders involve persistent disturbances in mood, motivation, and cognitive functioning. CORE FEATURES: - Persistent low mood or loss of interest/pleasure - Changes in sleep, appetite, or energy - Feelings of worthlessness or guilt - Difficulty concentrating - Psychomotor changes - Thoughts of death or self-harm DURATION: - Symptoms typically persist for at least two weeks SEVERITY: - Severity is determined by symptom count, intensity, and level of functional impairment IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE: - Any expression of suicidal thoughts requires immediate professional support -------------------------------------------------- AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) -------------------------------------------------- Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. CORE DOMAINS: 1. Social Communication and Interaction: - Differences in social reciprocity - Difficulty interpreting social cues - Differences in nonverbal communication - Challenges developing or maintaining relationships 2. Restricted and Repetitive Patterns: - Repetitive behaviors or speech - Strong preference for routines - Intense or focused interests - Sensory sensitivities DEVELOPMENTAL",

Social Communication and Interaction: - Differences in social reciprocity - Difficulty interpreting social cues - Differences in nonverbal communication - Challenges developing or maintaining relationships 2. Restricted and Repetitive Patterns: - Repetitive behaviors or speech - Strong preference for routines - Intense or focused interests - Sensory sensitivities DEVELOPMENTAL CONTEXT: - Traits are typically present from early development - Presentation varies widely across individuals NEURODIVERSITY NOTE: - Autism represents a natural variation in human neurodevelopment - Traits may be associated with both challenges and strengths - Support needs vary by individual and environment -------------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT CLINICAL NOTES -------------------------------------------------- - Screening tools identify patterns of traits or symptoms, not diagnoses - Diagnosis requires comprehensive evaluation by qualified professionals - Cultural, developmental, and contextual factors must be considered - Comorbidity between conditions is common (e.g., ADHD and anxiety) ### Summary of DSM-5-TR Content and Structure The **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR)**, published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2022, represents a comprehensive update to DSM-5 (2013) integrating **scientific advances, previous online updates, and text clarifications**. It emphasizes clinical utility, cultural competence, and incorporates a dimensional approach alongside the traditional categorical classification. --- ### Key Features and Organizational Principles - **DSM-5-TR** includes **updated diagnostic criteria** for over 70 disorders, with **new diagnoses** such as **prolonged grief disorder** and symptom codes for suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior. - The manual aligns with the **ICD-10-CM coding system** for diagnostic consistency and facilitates international harmonization, though full criteria harmonization with ICD-11 is *ongoing*. - Disorders are organized developmentally, beginning with those manifesting early in life (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders) and concluding with disorders prevalent in later adulthood (e.g., neurocognitive disorders). - The manual integrates **cultural, sex- and gender-related diagnostic issues**, and for the first time, a **Work Group on Ethnoracial Equity and Inclusion** reviewed the text to ensure nonstigmatizing language and attention to systemic factors like racism. - **Dimensional and categorical approaches** coexist: DSM-5-TR remains primarily categorical, but it includes **dimensional measures** (e.g., symptom severity, cross-cutting symptom measures) to capture heterogeneity and subthreshold symptoms. --- ### Revision and Development Process - DSM-5-TR is the product of a **multi-stage revision process**: original DSM-5 Task Force development (2013), iterative online updates overseen by the DSM Steering Committee, and the current text revision by a large Revision Subcommittee. - The revision was supported by **extensive expert input** from over 200 field experts",

    "If you notice challenges related to attention, emotional regulation, sensory sensitivity, or anxiety, there are supportive steps you might consider. Breaking tasks into smaller steps, using visual reminders, or creating predictable routines can help reduce overwhelm. Adjusting your environment to minimize distractions or sensory overload may also be beneficial. Practices such as mindfulness, regular movement, and sufficient rest can support emotional regulation. Connecting with supportive people or communities who understand neurodivergent experiences can reduce feelings of isolation. If challenges significantly impact daily life, school, work, or relationships, seeking guidance from a qualified mental health or healthcare professional can be a helpful next step. A professional can offer personalized support and assessment.",
    "Neurodiversity refers to the natural variation in how human brains process information, experience emotions, and interact with the world. Differences in attention, sensory processing, communication, or emotional regulation are part of normal human diversity. Neurodivergent traits can present both challenges and strengths. Difficulties often arise not because something is \"wrong\" with a person, but because environments are not designed to support different thinking styles. Many people with neurodivergent traits develop creativity, deep focus on interests, strong empathy, pattern recognition, or innovative problem- solving abilities. Support, understanding, and appropriate accommodations can make a significant difference in daily functioning. Screening tools are meant to support self-understanding and guide next steps. They are not judgments, diagnoses, or measures of worth.",

    "Stress often shows up when demands feel bigger than our capacity to handle them. Some people feel it physically\u2014in their chest, stomach, or sleep patterns. Others notice it in their mind\u2014racing thoughts, irritability, or just feeling \"on edge\" all the time. It's your body's way of saying, \"I'm protecting you,\" even if it feels overwhelming. Anxiety isn't just \"worrying too much.\" It can feel like a persistent alarm bell that won't turn off. It might show up as restlessness, fatigue, or finding it really hard to focus on anything else. If you find yourself avoiding things you usually do because of this fear, that's a common sign of anxiety. Depression is different from just being sad. It can feel like the color has drained out of life. You might notice changes in your sleep or appetite, or just a heavy lack of energy. It keeps you from seeing your own worth. It\u2019s not laziness; it\u2019s a heavy weight you\u2019re carrying.",
    "When you notice sensory overload or feeling scattered, simple changes can really help. Breaking big tasks into tiny, manageable steps is a great way to reduce that feeling of pressure. Sometimes, just adjusting your meaningful environment\u2014like lowering lights or reducing noise\u2014can give your brain the break it needs. For emotional regulation, movement is surprisingly powerful. Even a short walk or some stretching can shift your state. Mindfulness isn't about emptying your mind, but just pausing to notice where you are right now. And remember, you don't have to do this alone\u2014connecting with people who \"get it\" can make a world of difference.",
    "Neurodiversity just means that differences in how our brains work\u2014like deep focus, sensory sensitivity, or different ways of socializing\u2014are natural. It\u2019s not about something being \"wrong\" with you; it\u2019s about having a brain that processes the world differently. Many autistic or ADHD individuals find they have unique strengths, like vivid creativity, strong empathy, or an ability to see patterns others miss. Often, the struggle comes from trying to force a unique brain into a standard mold. Understanding your own patterns is the first step to building a life that actually fits you.",
    "Work stress often feels like a never-ending to-do list where you never feel \"done.\" You might feel undervalued, constantly rushed, or like you have to be \"on\" all the time. It shows up as dreading Mondays or feeling too drained to do anything after work. Burnout is different\u2014it\u2019s like the battery is completely dead. You might feel cynical, detached, or like nothing you do matters anymore. Social stress can come from feeling judged, or feeling like you have to perform a certain version of yourself. It might make you withdraw, replay conversations in your head, or feel lonely even when you\u2019re with others. Chronic stress is the \"background noise\" kind\u2014where you've been in survival mode for so long you don't remember what relaxing feels like. It often shows up as physical aches, gut issues, or being easily startled. Trauma-linked stress feels deeper. It might not be about what's happening *now*, but your body reacting to the past.

In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Indi- viduals score in the range 0\u201350. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 ( SD= 6.5), sig- nificantly higher than Group 2 controls ( M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34 +) whereas 4% of men did so. Twice as many men (40%) as women (21%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The stu- dents in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but sci- entists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scien- tific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge hu- manities students. 6% of the student sample scored 32 + on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/math- ematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test\u2013retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.

Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored. KEYWORDS: Autism-Spectrum Quotient; Asperger syndrome; high-functioning autism; normal intel- ligence. INTRODUCTION Autism is defined in terms of abnormalities in so- cial and communication development, in the presence of marked repetitive behavior and limited imagination (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). As- perger syndrome (AS) is defined in terms of the indi- vidual meeting the same criteria for autism but with no history of cognitive or language delay, and not meeting the criteria for Pervasive Development Disorder (PDD), (ICD-10; World Health Organization, 1994). Language delay itself is de\ufb01ned as not using single words by 2 years of age, and/or phrase speech by 3 years of age. There is growing evidence that autism and AS are of genetic 5 0162-3257/01/0200-0005$19.50/0 \u00a9 2001 Plenum Publishing Corporation 1 Departments of Experimental Psychology and Psychiatry, Univer- sity of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3EB, United Kingdom. origin. The evidence is strongest for autism, and comes from twin and behavioral genetic family studies (Bai- ley et al.,1995; Bolton & Rutter, 1990; Folstein & Rut- ter, 1977, 1988). Family pedigrees of AS also implicate heritability (Gillberg, 1991). There is also an assump- tion, still under debate, that autism and AS lie on a con- tinuum of social-communication disability, with AS as the bridge between autism and normality (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Frith, 1991; Wing, 1981, 1988). The continuum view shifts us away from categorical diagnosis and to- wards a quantitative approach. Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments available for measuring where any given individual adult, with normal intelligence, lies on this continuum. Existing instruments, such as the ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview) (Le Couteur et al.,1989; Lord, Rutter, & Le Couteur, 1994), the ADOS-G (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) are fairly time-consuming to administer, and the CARS (Child- hood Autism Rating Scale) which can be brief, is not self-administered (Schopler, Reichler, & Renner, 1986). What is needed is a short, self-administered scale for identifying the degree to which any individ- ual adult of normal IQ may have \u201cautistic traits\u201d or what has been called \u201cthe broader phenotype\u201d (Bailey et al., 1995).

    "any individ- ual adult of normal IQ may have \u201cautistic traits\u201d or what has been called \u201cthe broader phenotype\u201d (Bailey et al., 1995). This would be useful for both scientific reasons (e.g., establishing who is \u201caffected\u201d and who is not, or the degree of caseness of an individual, in sci- entific comparisons), and potentially for applied rea- sons (e.g., screening for possibly affected individuals to assist in making referrals for a full diagnostic as- sessment). For both of these reasons, we developed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). The instrument\u2019s name was chosen because of the assumption, mentioned above, that there is an autism spectrum (Wing, 1988). 2 DESIGN OF THE AQ The AQ was designed to be short, easy to use, and easy to score. It is shown in the Appendix. It comprises 50 questions, made up of 10 questions assessing 5 dif- ferent areas: social skill (items 1,11,13,15,22,36,44,45, 47,48); attention switching (items 2,4,10,16,25,32,34, 37,43,46); attention to detail (items 5,6,9,12,19,23,28, 29,30,49); communication (items 7,17,18,26,27,31,33, 35,38,39); imagination (items 3,8,14,20,21,24,40,41, 42,50). Each of the items listed above scores 1 point if 6 Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, and Clubley the respondent records the abnormal or autistic-like be- havior either mildly or strongly (see below for scoring each item; Abnormality = poor social skill, poor com- munication skill, poor imagination, exceptional atten- tion to detail, poor attention-switching/strong focus of attention). Approximately half the items were worded to produce a \u201cdisagree\u201d response, and half an \u201cagree\u201d response, in a high scoring person with AS/HFA. This was to avoid a response bias either way. Following this, items were randomized with respect to both the ex- pected response from a high-scorer, and with respect to their domain. INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT Items were selected from the domains in the \u201ctriad\u201d of autistic symptoms (APA, 1994; Rutter, 1978; Wing & Gould, 1979), and from demonstrated areas of cogni- tive abnormality in autism. The AQ as shown in the Ap- pendix is the outcome of piloting multiple versions, over several years. The instrument was piloted on adults with AS or high-functioning autism (HFA), and age-matched controls. An early version was also interview-based, and required the coding of responses. Following piloting, items which controls scored on as often, or more often, than did people with autism/AS were omitted. Due to the concern over whether a condition like HFA or AS might impair one\u2019s ability to understand the items in the questionnaire, we checked",
    "and required the coding of responses. Following piloting, items which controls scored on as often, or more often, than did people with autism/AS were omitted. Due to the concern over whether a condition like HFA or AS might impair one\u2019s ability to understand the items in the questionnaire, we checked compre- hension with the patients in our pilot study. We did this by calling some patients into our lab, selected at ran- dom, where we had the opportunity to ask them about their responses. Comprehension of wording might be a greater problem in a less able population, but this in- strument is designed for high-functioning individuals who are perfectly able to read or discuss issues. For caution, however, parents independently completed an AQ for their child with AS/HFA. A related issue is whether a condition like AS or HFA might impair the subject\u2019s ability to judge their own social or commu- nicative behavior, due to subtle mind-reading problems (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Baron-Cohen, Jolliffe, Morti- more, & Robertson, 1997). If this occurred, this would lead a person to score lower on the AQ, rating their own behavior as more appropriate than it might really be. Any inaccuracies of this kind would therefore, if anything, lead to a conservative estimate of the per- son\u2019s true AQ score. However, to guard against false negatives, we included questions in both the social and communication domains that ask about the person\u2019s preferences, rather than only asking them to judge their 2 The term \u201cquotient\u201d is not used in the arithmetic sense (the result of dividing one quantity by another) but as derived from the Latin root quotiens (how much or how many). own behavior. Piloting revealed that such able subjects were certainly able to report on their own preferences and what they find easy or difficult. Equally, items in the other domains ask about their attentional prefer- ences or focus of attention (e.g., to dates, numbers, small sounds). There is no reason to expect that a high- functioning person with autism or AS would be at all impaired in being able to report faithfully on such items. The final version of the AQ has a forced-choice format, can be self-administered, and is straightforward to score since it does not depend on any interpretation in the scoring.

Subjects Four groups of subjects were tested: Group 1 com- prised 58 adults with AS/HFA (45 male, 13 female). This sex ratio of 3.5:1 (M:F) is similar to that found in other samples (Klin, Volkmar, Sparrow, Cicchetti, & Rourke, 1995). All subjects in this group had been di- agnosed by psychiatrists using established criteria for autism or AS (APA, 1994). They were recruited via sev- eral sources, including the National Autistic Society (UK), specialist clinics carrying out diagnostic assess- ments, and advertisements in newsletters/web pages for adults with AS/HFA. Their mean age was 31.6 years (SD = 11.8, range = 16.5\u201358.3). They had all attended mainstream schooling and were reported to have an IQ in the normal range. See below for a check of this. Their mean number of years in education was 14.2 ( SD = 2.41). Thirty-two had higher educational qualifications (university degrees). Their occupations reflected their mixed socioeconomic status (SES). Because we could not confirm age of onset of language with any reliabil- ity (due to the considerable passage of time), these in- dividuals are grouped together, rather than attempting to separate them into AS versus HFA. The final sample of 58 were those who responded from a larger sample of 63. Group 2 comprised 174 adults selected at random (76 male and 98 female). They were drawn from 500 adults sent the AQ by post, giving a return rate of 34.8%. They were all living in the East Anglia area. Their mean age was 37.0 years (SD= 7.7, range = 18.1\u201360.0). Their mean number of years in education was 13.9 ( SD = 2.34). 89 had university degrees, and their mix of oc- cupations was similar to that Group 1. In Groups 1 and 2, 15 individuals were randomly selected from the in- dividuals who had returned an AQ and invited into the lab to check prorated IQ, using four subtests of the WAIS-R (see below). Group 3 comprised 840 students in Cambridge University (454 male, 386 female). Their mean age was 21.0 years (SD= 2.9, range = 17.6\u201351.1).

Group 3 also allowed us to test if sci- entists differed from students in the humanities, given earlier reports (Baron-Cohen et al., 1998) suggesting that autism is more common in families of physicists, engineers, and mathematicians. Finally, Group 4 com- prised 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad (15 male, 1 female). They were included as a retest of this same association. Their mean age was 17.4 years (SD = 1.0, range = 15.3\u201318.7). Method Participants were sent the AQ by post, and they were instructed to complete it as quickly as possible (to avoid thinking about responses too long), and to complete it on their own. Participants in Group 2 had the option to complete this anonymously or not. To con- firm the diagnosis of adults in Group 1 being high func- tioning, 15 were randomly selected and invited into the lab for intellectual assessment using four subtests of the WAIS-R (Wechsler, 1958). The four subtests of the WAIS-R were Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design, and Picture Completion. On this basis, all of these had a prorated IQ of at least 85, that is, in the normal range (M = 106.5, SD = 8.0), and did not differ significantly from the subsample ( n = 15) selected from Group 1 (t test, p > .5), (M = 105.8, SD = 6.3).

RESULTS AS/HFA Versus Controls, and Sex Differences Mean total and subcategory AQ scores from each group are displayed in Table I. Comparing Groups 1 and 2 using an ANOVA of total AQ score by Group and Sex, we found, as predicted, that there was a main effect of Group, F(1, 228) = 328.9, p = .0001; the AS/HFA group scoring higher than the controls, and a two-way interaction of Group \u00b7 Sex, F(1, 228) = 6.01, p= .015; the control males scoring significantly higher than the control females ( t = 2.56, df = x, p < .01). There was no difference between mean AQ scores of men and women with AS/HFA. Group means on each subscore are also shown in Table I. See also Figs. 1 and 2 for graphic displays of the Group and Sex differences. The AS/HFA group differed from Group 2 on all subscores (t tests, p < .0001). Comparing the students (Group 3) to the randomly selected controls (Group 2), there was no main effect of Group, F(1, 1010) = 3.2, p= .07, and no Group \u00b7 Sex interaction, F(1, 1010) = 0.042, p = .84; but there was a significant effect of Sex, F(1, 1010) = 19.4, p = .0001, males scoring higher than females. This means that on the AQ the students do not differ from the general population sample, despite the differ- 8 Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, and Clubley ences in IQ and educational level between the two groups. Combining Groups 2 and 3, men and women differed on all subscales except local details ( ttests, all p < .0001).

Differences Between Types of Science We then tested if there were differences between the different types of scientists, or between male and fe- male scientists, in Group 3. The six types of Sciences (i.e., excluding the nonspecific category), by Sex, were compared in one ANOVA. There was a main effect of type of Science, F(5, 331) = 7.8, p< .0001, but no main effect of Sex, F(1, 331) = 3.0, p = .08, and no Sex \u00b7 Science-type interaction, F(5, 331) = 27.3, p= .62).

To retest the finding from Group 3 that mathematicians score significantly higher than controls, the final analysis compared Group 4 (Maths Olympiad) versus male humanities students from Group 3. Group 4 scored significantly higher than the male humanities students, t(133) =- 4.42, p= .0001. There were no dif- ferences between Group 4 and mathematicians from Group 3, t(99) =- 1.7, p = .09. Mean AQ and subscale scores from Group 4 are shown in Table I. Test\u2013Retest Reliability, and Self Versus Parent Report To establish test\u2013retest reliability, 17 students from Group 3 were asked to complete a second AQ 2 weeks after the first administration. Scores from the first and second AQs did not differ statistically, t(16) = 0.3, p = .75) and were strongly correlated ( r = .7, p= .002). To test if self-report by adults with AS/HFA was leading to inflated scores, all subjects in Group 1 were asked if a parent could also compete an AQ on them. Twenty-two of these families agreed to do this. The parent version of the AQ omitted 10 items out of 50 (items 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 20, 23, 27, 36, and 42), since these could only be answered subjectively. The mean difference in AQ score between self-report and parent report for the 40-item AQ was 2.8 points ( SD =- 0.6), parents scoring their child more highly than their The Autism-Spectrum Quotient 11 child\u2019s self-report. This shows that scores in Group 1 are, if anything, more conservative than would be es- timated by another judge. Item Analysis and Internal Consistency An item analysis (percentage of each group scor- ing on each item) is shown in Table IV. On only 2 items out of 50 (items 29 and 30) did controls score more than adults with AS/HFA, strongly confirming the value of these items for discriminating HFA/AS versus controls established at the pilot phase. These two items were conservatively retained in the analysis since, if",

On only 2 items out of 50 (items 29 and 30) did controls score more than adults with AS/HFA, strongly confirming the value of these items for discriminating HFA/AS versus controls established at the pilot phase. These two items were conservatively retained in the analysis since, if anything, they served to reduce the size of group dif- ferences. The internal consistency of items in each of the five domains was also calculated, and Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients were all moderate to high (Commu- nication = .65; Social, = .77; Imagination = .65; Local Details = .63; Attention Switching = .67). Regarding the decision to score \u201cslightly agree\u201d and \u201cdefinitely agree\u201d responses using 1 point only, a reanalysis dif- ferentiating these in terms of 1 versus 2 points led to the same pattern of results overall.

Considering Table V, and using the rule that a useful cutoff would discriminate the groups with as many true positives and as few false positives as pos- sible, an AQ score of 32 + was chosen, since 79.3% of 12 Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, and Clubley the AS/HFA group scored at this level, while only 2% of controls did so; 32 + also seems to be a useful cut- off for distinguishing females with AS/HFA (92.3% scoring at this point or above) versus control females (1% of",
    "79.3% of 12 Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, and Clubley the AS/HFA group scored at this level, while only 2% of controls did so; 32 + also seems to be a useful cut- off for distinguishing females with AS/HFA (92.3% scoring at this point or above) versus control females (1% of whom score at this point or above). Normal Sex Differences on the AQ Table V also shows that control females never score as high as 34 +, whereas 3.9% of control males do. Note also that at AQ score 20 +, there are twice as many males (40%) as females (21%) in the control group scoring at this intermediate point on the scale. This suggests that there is not only a sex difference on the AQ overall (as reflected in the male mean AQ being higher than the female mean), and a sex difference at high levels on the AQ (reflected in the sex ratio in Group 1 being 3.5:1), but that significantly more males than females in the general population show moderate levels of \u201cautistic traits\u201d (i.e., those traits that people with AS or HFA tend to endorse on the AQ). Validation of the AQ Among Controls We cannot determine the rate of false negatives in Group 2 (general population controls), as the majority of these completed the AQ anonymously. To validate the AQ in Group 3, we called in for clinical interview all subjects scoring 32 +, of whom 11 agreed to be in- terviewed. Using DSM-IV 7 criteria for autistic disorder, an experienced clinician (S.B-C.) sought to establish the number of criteria each subject met. The clinician remained blind to the AQ score of the subject being in- terviewed. Of the 11 subjects scoring 32 +, 7 met cri- teria for HFA or AS. No diagnoses were actually made for two reasons: No parent was present to provide in- dependent developmental data, and because none of those meeting criteria complained of any current un- happiness. Indeed, many of them reported that within a University setting their desire not to be sociable, to- gether with their desire to pursue their narrow or repet- itive interests (typically mathematics and computing) was not considered odd, and was even valued. Of the other 4, all met at least three criteria. In all 11 cases however, there was evidence from self-report of sig- nificant impairment in functioning during the school years (social",

As predicted, adults with AS/HFA scored significantly higher on the AQ than matched controls. 80% scored above a criti- cal minimum of 32 +, whereas only 2% of controls did so. This demonstrates that the AQ has reasonable face validity, since the questionnaire purports to measure autistic spectrum traits, and people with a diagnosis in- volving these traits score highly on it. AQ scores from a general population sample and a Cambridge student sample were not significantly different, implying that IQ and SES do not appear to influence AQ. The AQ can also be said to have reasonable construct validity, in that items purporting to measure each of the five do- mains of interest (social, communication, imagination, attention to detail, and attention switching) show mod- erate to high alpha coefficients. Future work needs to test the false negative rate by carrying out diagnostic assessments on a larger number of subjects in the con- trol group than was possible here. The AQ has excel- lent test\u2013retest reliability. The group differences be- tween the AS/HFA group versus controls are if anything conservative, given that parents score their child with AS/HFA higher than they score by self- report. Within the control group, men score slightly but significantly higher than women, both overall, and at intermediate and high levels of autistic traits. This is consistent with the extreme male brain theory of autism (Asperger, 1944; Baron-Cohen & Hammer, 1997; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Stone, & Rutherford, 1999) and may have implications for the marked sex ratioinAS(Wing,1981).Finally,scientistsscorehigher thannonscientists;andwithinthesciences,mathemat- ics, physical scientists, computer scientists, and engi- neersscorehigherthanthemorehumanorlife-centered sciencesofmedicine(includingveterinaryscience)and biology.

A score of 32 + appears to be a useful cut- off for distinguishing individuals who have clinically significant levels of autistic traits. Such a high score on the AQ however does not mean an individual has AS or HFA, since a diagnosis is only merited if the individual is suffering a clinical level of distress as a result of their autistic traits. As shown in the subsample of students in Group 3 above, 80% of those scoring 32 + met DSM-IV criteria for HFA, but did not merit a diagnosis as they were not suffering any significant distress. If an adult The Autism-Spectrum Quotient 15 scores above 32 on the AQ, and is suffering some dis- tress, we suggest this merits a referral to an expert clin- ician for a full diagnostic assessment. A limitation of this instrument is that it may not be appropriate for pa- tients with low IQ, since the AQ assumes reading com- prehension skills.

A limitation of this instrument is that it may not be appropriate for pa- tients with low IQ, since the AQ assumes reading com- prehension skills. Future work could include adminis- tering the AQ to other psychiatric control groups, in order to further determine its specificity, and to repli- cate the current results from Group 1 with patients di- agnosed using standardized instruments. We suggest the AQ fills a gap for a brief assessment instrument for HFA/AS in adults of normal intelligence. APPENDIX The Autistic-Spectrum Quotient 1.

One afternoon, walking around the vast, open campus, we fell into conversation with a staff psychiatrist, who told us about his latest interesting patient. She was a young woman who had been admitted a few days earlier. While attend- ing college nearby, she had suddenly become agitated\u2014 speaking rapidly and rushing in a frenzy from one activity",
    "campus, we fell into conversation with a staff psychiatrist, who told us about his latest interesting patient. She was a young woman who had been admitted a few days earlier. While attend- ing college nearby, she had suddenly become agitated\u2014 speaking rapidly and rushing in a frenzy from one activity to another. After she impulsively sold her nearly new Cor- vette for $500, her friends had brought her for evaluation. \u201cFive hundred dollars!\u201d exclaimed the psychiatrist. \u201cThat kind of thinking, that\u2019s schizophrenia!\u201d Now my friend and I had had just enough training in psychiatry to recognize that this young woman\u2019s symptoms and course of illness were far more consistent with an episode of mania than with schizophrenia. We were too young and callow to chal - lenge the diagnosis of the experienced clinician, but as we went on our way, we each expressed the fervent hope that this patient\u2019s care would be less flawed than her assess- ment. For decades, the memory of that blown diagnosis has haunted me, in part because it is by no means unique in the annals of mental health lore. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t until many years later that the first diagnostic manual to include specific criteria (DSM- III) was published. That book has since morphed into the enormous fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Everyone who evaluates and treats mental health patients must understand the latest edition of what has become the world standard for evaluation and diagnosis. But getting value from DSM-5 requires a great deal of concentration. Written by a com - mittee with the goal of providing standards for research as well as clinical practice in a variety of disciplines, it covers nearly every conceivable subject related to mental health. But you could come away from it not knowing how the diagnostic criteria trans- late to a real live patient. I wrote DSM-5 Made Easy to make mental health diagnosis more accessible to clinicians from all mental health professions. In these pages, you will find descriptions of every mental disorder, with emphasis on those that occur in adults. With it, you can learn how to diagnose each one of them.

With its careful use, no one today would mis- take that young college student\u2019s manic symptoms for schizophrenia. What Have I Done to Make DSM-5 Easy? Quick Guides. Opening each chapter is a summary of the diagnoses addressed therein\u2014and other disorders that might afflict patients who complain about similar problems. It also provides a useful index to the material in that chapter. Introductory material. The section on each disorder starts out with a brief description designed to orient you to the diagnosis. It includes a discussion of the major symptoms, perhaps a little historical information, and some of the demographics\u2014who is likely to have this disorder, and in what circumstances. Here, I\u2019ve tried to state that which I would want to know myself if I were starting out afresh as a student. Essential Features. OK, that\u2019s the name I\u2019ve given them in in DSM-5 Made Easy, but they\u2019re also known as prototypes . I\u2019ve used them in an effort to make the DSM-5 criteria more accessible. For years, we working clinicians have known that when we evaluate a new patient, we don\u2019t grab a list of emotional and behavioral attributes and start ticking off boxes. Rather, we compare the data we\u2019ve gathered to the picture we\u2019ve formed of the various mental and behavioral disorders. When the data fit an image, we have an \u201caha!\u201d experience and pop that diagnosis into our list of differential diagnoses. (From long experience and conversations with countless other experienced clinicians, I can assure you that this is exactly how it works.) Very recently, a study of mood and anxiety disorders* has found that clinicians who make diagnoses by rating their patients against prototypes perform at least as well as, and sometimes better than, other clinicians who adhere to strict criteria. That is, it can be shown that prototypes have validity even greater than that of some DSM diagnostic criteria. Moreover, prototypes are reported to be usable by clinicians with a relatively modest level of training and experience; you don\u2019t have to be coming off 20 years of clinical work to have success with prototypes. And clinicians report that prototypes are less cumbersome and more clinically useful. (However\u2014and I hasten to underscore this point\u2014the prototypes used in the studies I have just mentioned were generated from",
    "and experience; you don\u2019t have to be coming off 20 years of clinical work to have success with prototypes. And clinicians report that prototypes are less cumbersome and more clinically useful. (However\u2014and I hasten to underscore this point\u2014the prototypes used in the studies I have just mentioned were generated from the diagnostic criteria inherent in the DSM criteria.) The bottom line: Sure, we need criteria, but we can adapt them so they work better for us. So once you\u2019ve collected the data and read the prototypes, I recommend that you *DeFife JA, Peart J, Bradley B, Ressler K, Drill R, Westen D: Validity of prototype diagnosis for mood and anxiety disorders. JAMA Psychiatry 2013; 70(2): 140\u2013148. 2 Introduction assign a number to indicate how closely your patient fits the ideal of any diagnoses you are considering. Here\u2019s the accepted convention: 1 = little or no match; 2 = some match (the patient has a few features of the disorder); 3 = moderate match (there are significant, important features of the disorder); 4 = good match (the patient meets the standard\u2014the diagnosis applies); 5 = excellent match (a classic case). Obviously, the vignettes I\u2019ve provided will always match at the 4 or 5 level (if not, why would I use them as illustrative examples?), so I haven\u2019t bothered to grade them on the 5-point scale. But you should do just that with each new patient you interview. Of course, there may be times you\u2019ll want to turn to the official DSM-5 criteria. One is when you\u2019re just starting out, so you can get a picture of the exact numbers of each type of criteria that officially count the patient as \u201cin.\u201d Another would be when you are doing clinical research, where you must be able to report that participants were all selected according to scientifically studied, reproducible criteria. And even as an expe- rienced clinician, I return to the actual criteria from time to time. Perhaps it\u2019s just to have in my mind the complete information that allows me to communicate with other clinicians; sometimes it is related to my writing. But mostly, whether I am with patients or talking with students, I stick to the prototype method\u2014just like nearly every other working clinician. The Fine Print.

    "But mostly, whether I am with patients or talking with students, I stick to the prototype method\u2014just like nearly every other working clinician. The Fine Print. Most of the diagnostic material included in these sections is what I call boilerplate. I suppose that sounds pejorative, but each Fine Print section actually con- tains one or more important steps in the diagnostic process. Think of it this way: The prototype is useful for purposes of inclusion, whereas the boilerplate is useful largely for the also important exclusion of other disorders and delimitation from normal. The boilerplate verbiage includes several sorts of stereotyped phrases and warnings, which as an aid to memory I\u2019ve dubbed the D\u2019s . (I started out by using \u201cDon\u2019t disregard the D\u2019s\u201d or similar phrases, but soon got tired of all the typing; so, I eventually adopted \u201cthe D\u2019s\u201d as shorthand.) Differential diagnosis. Here I list all the disorders to consider as alternatives when evaluating symptoms. In most cases, this list starts off with substance use disorders and general medical disorders, which despite their relative infrequency you should always place first on the list of disorders competing for your consideration. Next I put in those conditions that are most treatable, and hence should be addressed early. Only at the end do I include those that have a dismal prognosis, or that you can\u2019t do very much to treat. I call this the safety principle of differential diagnosis. Distress or disability. Most DSM-5 diagnostic criteria sets require that the patient experience distress or some form of impairment (in work, social interactions, inter- personal relations, or something else). The purpose is to ensure that we discrimi - nate people who are patients from those who, while normal, perhaps have lives with interesting aspects. What Have I Done to Make DSM-5 Easy? 3 as best I can tell, distress receives one definition in all of DSM-5 ( campbell\u2019s Psychiat- ric Dictionary doesn\u2019t even list it). The DSM-5 sections on trichotillomania and excoria - tion (skin- picking) disorder both describe distress as including negative feelings such as embarrassment and forfeiture of control. It\u2019s unclear, however, whether the same defini- tion is employed anywhere else, or what might be the dominant thinking throughout the manual. but for me, some combination of lost pride, shame, and control works pretty well as a definition. (DSM-IV didn\u2019t define distress anywhere.) Duration. Many disorders require that symptoms",
    "It\u2019s unclear, however, whether the same defini- tion is employed anywhere else, or what might be the dominant thinking throughout the manual. but for me, some combination of lost pride, shame, and control works pretty well as a definition. (DSM-IV didn\u2019t define distress anywhere.) Duration. Many disorders require that symptoms be present for a certain mini - mum length of time before they can be diagnosed. Again, this is to ensure that we don\u2019t go around indiscriminately handing out diagnoses to everyone. For example, nearly everyone will feel blue or down at one time or another; to qualify for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder, it has to hang on for at least a couple of weeks. Demographics. A few disorders are limited to certain age groups or genders. Coding Notes. Many of the Essential Features listings conclude with these notes, which supply additional information about specifiers, subtypes, severity, and other subjects relevant to the disorder in question. Here you\u2019ll find information about specifying subtypes and judging severity for different disorders. I\u2019ve occasionally put in a signpost pointing to a discussion of prin - ciples you can use to determine that a disorder is caused by the use of substances. Sidebars. To underscore or augment what you need to know, I have sprinkled sidebar information throughout the text (such as the one above). Some of these merely highlight information that will help you make a diagnosis quickly. Some contain historical infor- mation and other sidelights about diagnoses that I\u2019ve found interesting. Many include editorial asides\u2014my opinions about patients, the diagnostic process, and clinical mat - ters in general. Vignettes. I have based this book on that reliable device, the clinical vignette. As a stu- dent, I found that I often had trouble keeping in mind the features of diagnosis (such as it was back then). But once I had evaluated and treated a patient, I always had a mental image to help me remember important points about symptoms and differential diagno- sis. I hope that the more than 130 patients I have described in DSM-5 Made Easy will do the same for you. Evaluation. This section summarizes my thinking for every patient I\u2019ve written about. I explain how the patient fits the diagnostic criteria and why I think other diagnoses are unlikely.

I explain how the patient fits the diagnostic criteria and why I think other diagnoses are unlikely. Sometimes I suggest that additional history or medical or psychological testing should be obtained before a final diagnosis is given. The conclusions stated 4 Introduction here allow you to match your thinking against mine. There are two ways you can do this. One is by picking out from the vignette the Essential Features I\u2019ve listed for each diagnosis. But when you want to follow the thinking of the folks who wrote the actual DSM-5, I\u2019ve also included references (in parentheses) to the individual criteria. If you disagree with any of my interpretations, I hope you\u2019ll e-mail me (morrjame@ohsu.edu ). And for updated information, visit my website: www.guilford.com/jm. Final diagnosis. Usually code numbers are assigned in the record room, and we don\u2019t have to worry too much about them. That\u2019s fortunate, for they are sometimes less than perfectly logical. But to tell the record room folks how to proceed, we need to put all the diagnostic material that seems relevant into verbiage that conforms to the approved format. My final diagnoses not only explain how I\u2019d code each patient; they also provide models to use in writing up the diagnoses for your own patients. Tables. I\u2019ve included a number of tables to try to give you an overall picture of various topics\u2014the variety of specifiers that apply across different diagnoses, a list of physi - cal disorders that can produce emotional and behavioral symptoms. Those that are of principal use in a given chapter I\u2019ve included in that chapter. A few, which apply more generally throughout the book, you\u2019ll find in the Appendix. My writing. Throughout, I\u2019ve tried to use language that is as simple as possible. My goal has been to make the material sound as though it was written by a clinician for use with patients, not by a lawyer for use in court. Wherever I\u2019ve failed, I hope you will e-mail me to let me know. At some point, I\u2019ll try to put it right, either in a future edition or on my website (or both).

    "At some point, I\u2019ll try to put it right, either in a future edition or on my website (or both). Structure of DSM-5 Made Easy The first 18 chapters* of this book contain descriptions and criteria for the major men- tal diagnoses and personality disorders. Chapter 19 comprises information concerning other terms that you may find useful. Many of these are Z-codes (ICD-9 calls them V-codes), which are conditions that are not mental disorders but may require clini - cal attention anyway. Most noteworthy are the problems people with no actual mental disorder have in relating to one another. (Occasionally, you might even list a Z-code/V- code as the reason a patient was referred for evaluation.) Also described here are codes that indicate medications\u2019 effects, malingering, and the need for more diagnostic infor- mation. *OK, I cheated a little. DSM-5 actually has 19, but for ease of description, I combined the two mood disor- der chapters into one (which is how they were in DSM-IV). However, no confusion should result; DSM-5 doesn\u2019t number its chapters, anyway. Structure of DSM-5 Made Easy 5 Chapter 20 contains a very brief description of diagnostic principles, followed by some additional case vignettes, which are generally more complicated than those pre - sented earlier in the book. I\u2019ve annotated these case histories to help you to review the diagnostic principles and criteria covered previously. Of course, I could include only a small fraction of all DSM-5 diagnoses in this section. Throughout the book, I have tried to give you clinically relevant and accessible information, written in simple, declarative sentences that describe what you need to know in diagnosing a patient. Quirks Here are a few comments regarding some of my idiosyncrasies. Abbreviations. I\u2019ll cop to using some nonstandard abbreviations, especially for the names of disorders. For example, BPsD (for brief psychotic disorder) isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll read elsewhere, certainly not in DSM-5. I\u2019ve used it and others for the sake of shortening things up just a bit, and thus perhaps reducing ever so slightly the amount of time it takes to read all this stuff. I use these ad hoc abbreviations just in the sections about specific disorders, so don\u2019t worry about having to remember them longer than the time you\u2019re reading about these disorders. Indeed, I can think of two disorders that are sometimes abbreviated CD and four that are sometimes abbreviated SAD, so always",
    "use these ad hoc abbreviations just in the sections about specific disorders, so don\u2019t worry about having to remember them longer than the time you\u2019re reading about these disorders. Indeed, I can think of two disorders that are sometimes abbreviated CD and four that are sometimes abbreviated SAD, so always watch for context. My quest for shortening has also extended to the chapter titles. In the service of seeming inclusive, DSM-5 has sometimes overcomplicated these names, in my view. So you\u2019ll find that I\u2019ve occasionally (not always\u2014I\u2019ve got my obsessive\u2013 compulsive dis- order under control!) shortened them up a bit for convenience. You shouldn\u2019t have any problem knowing where to turn for sleep disorders (which DSM-5 calls sleep\u2013wake disorders), mood disorders ( bipolar and related disorders plus depressive disorders ), psychotic (schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic) disorders, cognitive (neurocog- nitive) disorders, substance (substance- related and addictive) disorders, eating (feeding and eating) disorders, and various other disorders from which I\u2019ve simply dropped and related from the official titles. Similarly, I\u2019ve sometimes dropped the /medication from substance/medication- induced [just about anything]. {Curly braces}. I\u2019ve used these in the Essential Features and in some tables to indicate when there are two mutually exclusive specifier choices, such as {with}{without} good prognostic features. Again, it just shortens things up a bit. Severity specifiers. One of the issues with DSM-5 is its use of complicated severity specifiers that differ from one chapter to another, and sometimes from one disorder to the next. Some of these are easier to use than others. For example, for the psychoses, we are offered the Clinician-Rated Dimensions of 6 Introduction Psychosis Symptom Severity (CRDPSS?), which asks us to rate on a 5-point scale, based on the past 7 days, each of eight symptoms (the five psychosis symptoms of schizophre- nia [p. 58] plus impaired cognition, depression, and mania); there is no overall score, only the eight individual components, which we are encouraged to rate again every few days. My biggest complaint about this scale, apart from its complexity and the time required, is that it gives us no indication as to overall functioning\u2014only the degree to which the patient experiences each of the eight symptoms. Helpfully, DSM-5 informs us that we are allowed to rate the patient \u201cwithout using this severity specifier,\u201d an offer that many clinicians will surely rush to accept. Evaluating functionality. Whatever happened to the Global Assessment of",
    "overall functioning\u2014only the degree to which the patient experiences each of the eight symptoms. Helpfully, DSM-5 informs us that we are allowed to rate the patient \u201cwithout using this severity specifier,\u201d an offer that many clinicians will surely rush to accept. Evaluating functionality. Whatever happened to the Global Assessment of Function - ing (GAF)? In use from DSM-III-R through DSM-IV-TR, the GAF was a 100-point scale that reflected the patient\u2019s overall occupational, psychological, and social func - tioning\u2014but not physical limitations or environmental problems. The scale specified symptoms and behavioral guidelines to help us determine our patients\u2019 GAF scores. Perhaps because of the subjectivity inherent in this scale, its greatest usefulness lay in tracking changes in a patient\u2019s level of functioning across time. (Another problem: It was a mash-up of severity, disability, suicidality, and symptoms.) However, the GAF is now G-O-N-E, eliminated for several reasons (as described in a 2013 talk by Dr. William Narrow, research director for the DSM-5 Task Force). Dr. Narrow (accurately) pointed out that the GAF mixed concepts (psychosis with suicidal ideas, for example) and that it had problems with interrater reliability. Furthermore, what\u2019s really wanted is a disability rating that helps us understand how well a patient can fulfill occupational and social responsibilities, as well as generally participate in society. For that, the Task Force recommends the World Health Organization Dis - ability Assessment Schedule, Version 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), which was developed for use with clinical as well as general populations and has been tested worldwide. DSM-5 gives it on page 747; it can also be accessed online ( www.who.int/classifications/icf/ whodasii/en/). It is scored as follows: 1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, and 5 = extreme. Note that scoring systems for the two measures are reciprocal; a high GAF score more or less equates with a low WHODAS 2.0 rating. After quite a bit of experimentation, I decided that the WHODAS 2.0 is so heav - ily weighted toward physical abilities that it poorly reflects the qualities mental health clinicians are interested in. Some of the most severely ill mental patients received a only a moderate WHODAS 2.0 score; for example, Velma Dean (p. 90) scored 20 on the GAF but 1.6 on the WHODAS 2.0. In addition, calculation of the WHODAS 2.0 score rests on the answers given by the patient (or clinician) to 36 questions\u2014a burden of",
    "mental patients received a only a moderate WHODAS 2.0 score; for example, Velma Dean (p. 90) scored 20 on the GAF but 1.6 on the WHODAS 2.0. In addition, calculation of the WHODAS 2.0 score rests on the answers given by the patient (or clinician) to 36 questions\u2014a burden of data collection that many busy professionals will not be able to carry. And, because these answers cover conditions over the previous month, the score cannot accurately represent patients with rapidly evolving mental disorders. The GAF, on the other hand, is a fairly simple (if subjective) way to estimate severity. So, after much thought, I\u2019ve decided not to recommend the WHODAS 2.0 after all. (Anyone who is interested in further discussion can write to me; I\u2019ll be happy to send Quirks 7 along a chart that compares the GAF with the WHODAS 2.0 for every patient men - tioned in this book.) Rather, here\u2019s my fix as regards evaluating function and severity, and it\u2019s the final quirk I\u2019ll mention: Go ahead and use the GAF. Nothing says that we can\u2019t, and I find it sometimes useful for tracking a patient\u2019s progress through treatment. It\u2019s quick, easy (OK, it\u2019s also subjective), and free. You can specify the patient\u2019s current level of functioning, or the highest level in any past time frame. You\u2019ll find it in the Appendix of this book. Using This Book There are several ways in which you might use DSM-5 Made Easy. Studying a diagnosis. Of course, you might go about this in several ways, but here\u2019s how I\u2019d do it. Scan the introductory information for some background, then read the vignette. Next, compare the information in the vignette to the Essential Fea - tures, to assure yourself that you can pick out what\u2019s important diagnostically. If you want to see how well the vignettes fit the actual DSM-5 criteria, read through the vignette evaluations; there I\u2019ve touched upon each of the important diagnostic points. In each evaluation section, you\u2019ll also find a discussion of the differential diagnosis, as well as some other conditions often found in association with the disorder in question. Evaluating a patient whose diagnosis you think you know. Read through the Essential Features, then check the information you have on this patient against the prototype.

Follow the sequence given just above, with one excep- tion: After identifying one of several areas of clinical interest as a diagnostic pos - sibility\u2014let\u2019s say an anxiety disorder\u2014you might want to start with the Quick Guide in the relevant chapter. There you will find capsule statements (too brief even to be called summaries) that might direct you to one or more disorders to consider further. Some patients will have problems in a number of areas, so you may have to explore several chapters to select all of the right diagnoses. Chapter 20 provides some additional pointers on diagnostic strategy. Getting the broader view. Finally, there are a lot of disorders out there. Many will be familiar to you, but for others your information may be a little sketchy. So just reading through the book and hitting the high points (perhaps sampling the vignettes) may load your quiver with a few new diagnostic arrows. I hope that 8 Introduction eventually you\u2019ll read the entire book. Besides introducing you to a lot of mental disorders, it should also give you a feel for how a diagnostician might approach an array of clinical problems. Whatever course you take, I recommend that you confine your reading to rela - tively short segments. I have done my best to simplify the criteria and to explain the reasoning behind them. But if you consider more than a few diagnoses at a time, they\u2019ll probably begin to run together in your mind. I also recommend one other step to help you learn faster: After you have read through a vignette, go back and try to pick out each of the Essential Features before you look at my evaluation.

    "step to help you learn faster: After you have read through a vignette, go back and try to pick out each of the Essential Features before you look at my evaluation. You will retain the material better if you actively match the case history information with these features than if you just rely on passively absorbing what I have written. Code Numbers I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve been played a rough trick as regards the code numbers we use. DSM-5 came out just as the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10) was about to be brought into full play in the United States. (For years, it has already been in use elsewhere in the world.) So at the time of DSM-5\u2019s publication, the old ICD-9* was still in use. The change-over is currently scheduled for October 1, 2014. DSM-5 has printed the ICD-10 code numbers for diagnoses in parentheses. I assume that readers will be using the book for many years, so I\u2019ve given the ICD-10 versions pride of place, with the old numbers indicated in square brackets. Here\u2019s an example: F40.10 [300.23] Social anxiety disorder However, we\u2019ll probably be translating back and forth between ICD-9 and ICD-10 for another decade or so. One feature of ICD-10 codes is that they are much more complete than was true for ICD-9. That serves us well for accurate identification, retrieval of information for research, and other informational purposes. But it increases the number of, um, num - bers we have to be familiar with. Mostly, I\u2019ve tried to include what you need to know along with the diagnostic information associated with each disorder I discuss. Some of this information is so extensive and complex that I have condensed it into one or two tables. Most notable of these is Table 15.2 in Chapter 15, which gives the ICD-10 code numbers for substance- related mental disorders. *Technically, both ICDs are a version called CM (for Clinical Modification)\u2014hence ICD-9-CM and ICD- 10-CM. I\u2019ll use the CM versions here, but I\u2019m going to avoid the extra typing labor. So I refer just to ICD- 10, period.

    "ICD- 10, period. Code Numbers 9 Using the DSM-5 Classification System After decades of DSM advocacy for five axes on which to record the biopsychosocial assessment of our patients, DSM-5 has at last taken the ultimate step\u2014and reversed course completely. Now all mental, personality, and physical disorders are recorded in the same place, with the principal diagnosis mentioned first. When you\u2019ve made a \u201cdue to\u201d diagnosis (such as catatonic disorder due to tuberous sclerosis), the ICD convention is to list first the physical disease process. The actual reason for the visit comes second, with the parenthetical statement (reason for visit) or (principal diagnosis) appended. I\u2019m not sure just how often clinicians will adhere to this convention. Many will reason, I suspect, that this is a medical records issue and pay it no further mind. In any event, here is how you can write up the diagnosis. Obviously, you need to record every mental diagnosis. Nearly every patient will have at least one of these, and many will have two or more. For example, imagine that you have a patient with two diagnoses: bipolar I disorder and alcohol use disorder. (Note, incidentally, that I\u2019ve followed DSM-5\u2019s refreshing new style, which is to aban- don the previous, somewhat Germanic practice of capitalizing the names of specific diagnoses.) Following the DSM-5 convention, first list the diagnosis most responsible for the current evaluation. Suppose that, while evaluating the social anxiety disorder, you discovered that your patient also was drinking enough alcohol to qualify for a diagnosis of mild alcohol use disorder. Then the diagnosis should read: F40.10 [300.23] Social anxiety disorder F10.10 [305.00] Alcohol use disorder, mild In this example, the first diagnosis would have to be social anxiety disorder (that\u2019s why the patient sought treatment). And of course, if the alcohol use was what had prompted the evaluation, you\u2019d reverse the places for the two diagnoses. DSM-IV required a separate location (the notorious Axis II) for the personality disorders and what was then called mental retardation. The purpose was to give special status to these lifelong attributes and to help ensure that they would not be ignored when we were dealing with our patients\u2019 often more pressing major pathology. But the logic of the division wasn\u2019t always impeccable\u2014so, partly to coordinate its approach with how the rest of the world now views mental disorders, DSM-5 has done away with axes. In any event,",
    "would not be ignored when we were dealing with our patients\u2019 often more pressing major pathology. But the logic of the division wasn\u2019t always impeccable\u2014so, partly to coordinate its approach with how the rest of the world now views mental disorders, DSM-5 has done away with axes. In any event, personality disorders and mental retardation (or intellectual disabil- ity, as it now is) are included right along with all other diagnoses, mental and physical. I think that this is a good thing, though, like all change, it\u2019ll take a little while for us older clinicians to get used to it. It also means that material such as a patient\u2019s GAF score (or WHODAS 2.0 rating, should you opt to use it) will have to be placed in the body of your summary statement. 10 Introduction An Uncertain Diagnosis When you\u2019re not sure whether a diagnosis is correct, consider using the DSM-5 quali- fier (provisional). This term may be appropriate if you believe that a certain diagnosis is correct, but you lack sufficient history to support your impression. Or perhaps it is still early in the course of your patient\u2019s illness, and you expect that more symptoms will develop shortly. Or you may be waiting for laboratory tests to confirm the presence of another medical condition that you suspect underlies your patient\u2019s illness. Any of these situations could warrant a provisional diagnosis. A couple of DSM-5 diagnoses\u2014 schizophreniform psychosis and brief psychotic disorder\u2014 require you to append (pro- visional) if the symptoms have not yet resolved. But you could use this term in just about any situation where it seems that safe diagnostic practice warrants it. What about a patient who comes very close to meeting full criteria, who has been ill for a long time, who has responded to treatment appropriate for the diagnosis, and who has a family history of the same disorder? Such a patient deserves a definitive diagnosis, even though the criteria are not quite met. That\u2019s one reason I\u2019ve gone over to the use of prototypes. after all, diagnoses are not decided by the criteria; diagnoses are decided by clinicians, who use criteria as guidelines. That\u2019s guidelines, as in \u201chelp you,\u201d not shackles, as in \u201crestrain you.\u201d actually, DSM-5 has provided another way to list a diagnosis that seems uncertain: \u201cother specified [name of] disorder.\u201d This allows you to put down the name of the category",

That\u2019s guidelines, as in \u201chelp you,\u201d not shackles, as in \u201crestrain you.\u201d actually, DSM-5 has provided another way to list a diagnosis that seems uncertain: \u201cother specified [name of] disorder.\u201d This allows you to put down the name of the category along with the specific reason you find the patient doesn\u2019t meet criteria for the diagnosis. For a patient who has a massive hoard of useless material in the house, but who has suf - fered no distress or disability, you could record \u201cother specified hoarding disorder, lack of distress or impairment.\u201d I\u2019ll bet we\u2019d both be interested to learn just how often this option gets exercised. Indicating Severity of a Disorder DSM-5 includes specific severity specifiers for many diagnoses. They are generally pretty self- explanatory, and I\u2019ve usually tried to boil them down just a bit, for the sake of your sanity and mine. DSM-IV provided the GAF as a generic way to indicate severity; I\u2019ve already indicated above that I\u2019d like to continue using it. Other Specifiers Many disorders include specifiers indicating a wide variety of information\u2014with (or without) certain defined accompanying symptoms; current degrees of remission; and course features such as early (or late) onset or recovery, either partial or full. Some of Using the DSM-5 Classification System 11 these specifiers require additional code numbers; some are just a matter of added ver - biage. Add as many of these as seem appropriate. Each one potentially helps the next clinician understand that patient just a little better. Physical Conditions and Disorders Physical illness may have a direct bearing on the patient\u2019s mental diagnoses; this is especially true of the cognitive disorders. In other cases, physical illness may affect (or be affected by) the management of a mental disorder. An example would be hyperten- sion in a psychotic patient who believes that the medication has been poisoned. (Some of this stuff is formalized in the diagnosis of psychological factors affecting other men - tal conditions; see Chapter 8, p. 266.) In any event, whereas physical disorders used to have their own axis, that\u2019s no longer the case either. In fact, the ICD-10 recording scheme requires that when a mental disorder is due to a physical condition, the physical condition must be listed first. Psychosocial and Environmental Problems You can report certain environmental or other psychosocial events or conditions that",
    "their own axis, that\u2019s no longer the case either. In fact, the ICD-10 recording scheme requires that when a mental disorder is due to a physical condition, the physical condition must be listed first. Psychosocial and Environmental Problems You can report certain environmental or other psychosocial events or conditions that might affect the diagnosis or management of your patient. These may have been caused by the mental disorder, or they may be independent events. They should have occurred within the year prior to your evaluation. If they occurred earlier, they must have con - tributed to the development of the mental disorder or must be a focus of treatment. DSM-5 requires that we use ICD-10 Z-codes (or ICD-9 V-codes) for the problems we identify. I\u2019ve given a reasonably complete list of those available in Chapter 19. When stating them, be as specific as possible. You\u2019ll find plenty of examples scattered through- out the text. Just What Is a Mental Disorder? There are many definitions of mental disorder , none of which is both accurate and complete. Perhaps this is because nobody yet has adequately defined the term abnor - mal. (Does it mean that the patient is uncomfortable? Then many patients with manic episodes are not abnormal. Is abnormal that which is unusual? Then highly intelligent people are abnormal.) The authors of DSM-5 provide the definition of mental disorder that they used to help them to decide whether to include a diagnosis in their book. Paraphrased, here it is: A mental disorder is a clinically important syndrome; that is, it\u2019s a collection of symptoms (these can be behavioral or psychological) that causes the person dis - ability or distress in social, personal, or occupational functioning. 12 Introduction The symptoms of any disorder must be something more than an expected reaction to an everyday event, such as the death of a relative. Behaviors that primarily reflect a conflict between the individual and society (for example, fanatic religious or political ideology) are not usually considered mental disorders. A number of additional points about the criteria for mental disorders bear empha- sizing: 1. Mental disorders describe processes, not people. This point is made explicit to address the fears of some clinicians that by using the criteria, they are somehow \u201cpigeonholing people.\u201d Patients with the same diagnosis may be quite different from one another in many important aspects, including symptoms, personal - ity, other",
    "Mental disorders describe processes, not people. This point is made explicit to address the fears of some clinicians that by using the criteria, they are somehow \u201cpigeonholing people.\u201d Patients with the same diagnosis may be quite different from one another in many important aspects, including symptoms, personal - ity, other diagnoses they may have, and the many distinctive aspects of their personal lives that have nothing at all to do with their emotional or behavioral condition. 2. To a degree, some of what\u2019s abnormal, and of course far more that isn\u2019t, is deter- mined by an individual\u2019s culture. Increasingly, we are learning to take culture into account when defining disorders and evaluating patients. 3. Don\u2019t assume that there are sharp boundaries between disorders, or between any disorder and so- called \u201cnormality.\u201d For example, the criteria for bipolar I and bipolar II disorders clearly set these two disorders off from one another (and from people who have neither). In reality, all bipolar conditions (and prob- ably lots of others) are likely to fit somewhere along a continuum. 4. The essential difference between a physical condition such as pneumonia or diabetes, and mental disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder, is that we know what causes pneumonia or diabetes. However, either mental dis- order could turn out to have a physical basis; perhaps we just haven\u2019t yet found it. In operational terms, the difference between physical and mental disorders is that the former are not the subjects of DSM-5 or of DSM-5 Made Easy. 5. Basically, DSM-5 follows the medical model of illness. By this, I don\u2019t mean that it recommends the prescription of medication. I mean that it is a descrip - tive work derived (largely) from scientific studies of groups of patients who appear to have a great deal in common, including symptoms, signs, and life course of their disease. Inclusion is further justified by follow-up studies, which show that people belonging to these groups have a predictable course of illness months, or sometimes years, down the road. 6. With a few exceptions, DSM-5 makes no assumptions about the etiology of most of these disorders. This is the famous \u201catheoretical approach\u201d that has been much praised and criticized. Of course, most clinicians would agree about the cause of some mental disorders (neurocognitive disorders, such as neurocogni- tive disorder due to Huntington\u2019s disease or with Lewy bodies, come to mind).",

Of course, most clinicians would agree about the cause of some mental disorders (neurocognitive disorders, such as neurocogni- tive disorder due to Huntington\u2019s disease or with Lewy bodies, come to mind). Just What Is a Mental Disorder? 13 The descriptions of the majority of DSM-5 diagnoses will be well accepted by clinicians whose philosophical perspectives include social and learning theory, psychodynamics, and psychopharmacology. Some Warnings In defining mental health disorders, several warnings seem worth repeating: 1. The fact that the manual omits a disorder doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t exist. Until now, with each new edition of the DSM, the number of listed mental disorders has increased. Depending on how you measure these things, DSM-5 appears to be an exception. On the one hand, it contains close to 600 codable conditions\u2014nearly double the number included in its predecessor, DSM-IV- TR.* On the other hand, DSM-5 contains some 157 main diagnoses (by my count, 155), an overall reduction of about 9%. This feat was achieved through a fair amount of lumping conditions under one title (as occurred, for example, in the sleep\u2013wake disorders chapter). However, there are probably still more conditions out there, waiting to be discovered. Prepare to invest in DSM-6 and DSM-6 Made Easy. 2. Diagnosis isn\u2019t for amateurs. Owning a set of prototypes is no substitute for pro- fessional training in interview techniques, diagnosis, and the many other skills that a mental health clinician needs. DSM-5 states\u2014and I agree\u2014that diagno- sis consists of more than just checking off the boxes on a bunch of symptoms. It requires education, training, patience, and yes, patients (that is, the experience of evaluating many mental health patients). 3. DSM-5 may not be uniformly applicable to all cultures. These criteria are derived largely from studies of North American and European patients. Although the DSMs have been widely used with great success throughout the world, it is not assured that mental disorders largely described by North American and Euro- pean clinicians will translate to other languages and other cultures. We should be wary of diagnosing pathology in patients who may express unusual beliefs that may be widely held in ethnic or other subcultures. An example would be a belief in witches once prevalent among certain Native Americans. Beginning on page 833 of DSM-5, you\u2019ll find",

An example would be a belief in witches once prevalent among certain Native Americans. Beginning on page 833 of DSM-5, you\u2019ll find a list of specific cultural syndromes. 4. DSM-5 isn\u2019t meant to have the force of law. Its authors recognize that the defi- nitions used by the judicial system are often at odds with scientific require - *To be fair, the vast bulk of the increase is due not to new disorders, but to ever- thinner slices of the origi - nal pie, served up with new numbers that reflect DSM-5\u2019s (and ICD-10\u2019s) finer diagnostic distinctions. Especially well represented are the now nearly 300 ways to say \u201csubstance/medication- induced this or that.\u201d 14 Introduction ments. Thus having a DSM-5 mental disorder may not exempt a patient from punishment or other legal restrictions on behavior. 5. Finally, the diagnostic manual is only as good as the people who use it. Late in his career, George Winokur, one of my favorite professors in medical school (and my first boss once I got out of training), co-wrote a brief paper* that inves- tigated how well the DSM (at that time, it was DSM-III) assured consistency of diagnosis. Even among clinicians at the same institution with similar diagnostic approaches, it turned out, there were problems. Winokur et al. especially called attention to the amount of time expended on making a mental health diagnosis, to systematic misinterpretations of criteria, and to nonsystematic misreadings of the criteria. They concluded, \u201cThe Bible may tell us so, but the criteria don\u2019t. They are better than what we had, but they are still a long way from perfect.\u201d In DSM-5, those statements are still true. The Patients Many of the patients I\u2019ve described in the vignettes are composites of several people I have known; some I\u2019ve reported just as I knew them. In every instance, though (except the very few in which I have used actual well-known persons), I have tweaked the vital information to protect identities, to provide additional data, and sometimes just to add interest. Of course, the vignettes do not present all of the features of the diagnoses they are meant to illustrate, but then hardly any patient does. My intention has been, rather, to convey the",

Of course, the vignettes do not present all of the features of the diagnoses they are meant to illustrate, but then hardly any patient does. My intention has been, rather, to convey the flavor of each disorder. Although I have provided over 130 vignettes to cover most of the major DSM-5 conditions, you\u2019ll notice some omissions. For one thing, there are just too many of them to illustrate every possible substance- related mood, psychotic, and anxiety disorder\u2014 that would occupy a book twice the length of this one. For disorders that begin in early life (Chapter 1), I have included vignettes and discussion only when a condition is also likely to be encountered in an adult. Specifically, these are intellectual disability, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Tourette\u2019s dis - order. However, you will find prototypes and brief introductory discussions for all dis- orders that begin during the neurodevelopmental period. DSM-5 Made Easy therefore contains diagnostic material pertinent to all DSM-5 mental disorders. *Winokur G, Zimmerman M, Cadoret R: \u2018Cause the Bible tells me so. Arch Gen Psychiatry 1988; 45 (7): 683\u2013684. The Patients 15 17 CHAPTEr 1 Neurodevelopmental Disorders In earlier DSMs, the name of this chapter was even more of a mouthful: \u201cDisorders Usually First Evident in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.\u201d Now the focus is on the individual during the formative period, when the development of the nervous system takes place, hence, and logically enough, neurodevelopmental. However, DSM-5 Made Easy emphasizes the evaluation of older patients\u2014later adolescence to maturity, and beyond. For that reason, I\u2019ve taken some liberties in arranging the conditions discussed in this chapter\u2014 placing those that I discuss at length at the beginning, and listing later just the prototypes (with some discussion) for others. Of course, many of the disorders considered in subsequent chapters can be first encountered in children or young adolescents; anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia are two examples that spring to mind. Conversely, many of the disorders discussed in this chapter can continue to cause problems for years after a child has grown up. But only a few commonly occupy clinicians who treat adults. For the remainder of the disorders DSM-5 includes in its first chapter, I provide introductions and Essential Features, but no illustrative case example.

For the remainder of the disorders DSM-5 includes in its first chapter, I provide introductions and Essential Features, but no illustrative case example. Quick Guide to the Neurodevelopmental Disorders In every Quick Guide, the page number following each item always refers to the point at which a discussion of it begins. Also mentioned below, just as in any other competent dif - ferential diagnosis, are various conditions arising in early life that are discussed in other chapters. Autism and Intellectual Disability Intellectual disability. This condition usually begins in infancy; people with it have low intel- ligence that causes them to need special help in coping with life (p. 20). Borderline intellectual functioning. This term indicates persons nominally ranked in the IQ range of 71\u201384 who do not have the coping problems associated with intellectual disability (p. 598). Autism spectrum disorder. From early childhood, the patient has impaired social interactions and communications, and shows stereotyped behaviors and interests (p. 26). Global developmental delay. Use when a child under the age of 5 seems to be falling behind developmentally but you cannot reliably assess the degree (p. 26). Unspecified intellectual disability. Use this category when a child 5 years old or older cannot be reliably assessed, perhaps due to physical or mental impairment (p. 26). Communication and Learning Disorders Language disorder. A child\u2019s delay in using spoken and written language is characterized by small vocabulary, grammatically incorrect sentences, and/or trouble understanding words or sentences (p. 46). Social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Despite adequate vocabulary and the ability to create sentences, these patients have trouble with the practical use of language; their con- versational interactions tend to be inappropriate (p. 49). Speech sound disorder. Correct speech develops slowly for the patient\u2019s age or dialect (p. 47). Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering). The normal fluency of speech is frequently disrupted (p. 47). Selective mutism. A child chooses not to talk, except when alone or with select intimates. DSM-5 lists this as an anxiety disorder (p. 187). Specific learning disorder. This may involve problems with reading (p. 51), mathematics (p. 51), or written expression (p. 52). Academic or educational problem. This Z-code is used when a scholastic problem (other than a learning disorder) is the focus of treatment (p. 591). Unspecified communication disorder.

This Z-code is used when a scholastic problem (other than a learning disorder) is the focus of treatment (p. 591). Unspecified communication disorder. Use for communication problems where you haven\u2019t enough information to make a specific diagnosis (p. 54). Tic and Motor Disorders Developmental coordination disorder. The patient is slow to develop motor coordination; some also have attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder or learning disorders (p. 43). Stereotypic movement disorder. Patients repeatedly rock, bang their heads, bite themselves, or pick at their own skin or body orifices (p. 44). Tourette\u2019s disorder. Multiple vocal and motor tics occur frequently throughout the day in these patients (p. 39). 18 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder. A patient has either motor or vocal tics, but not both (p. 42). Provisional tic disorder. Tics occur for no longer than 1 year (p. 42). Other or unspecified tic disorder. Use one of these categories for tics that do not meet the criteria for any of the preceding (p. 43). Attention- Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In this common condition (usually abbreviated as ADHD), patients are hyperactive, impulsive, or inattentive, and often all three (p. 33). Other specified (or unspecified) attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Use these catego- ries for symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, or inattention that do not meet full criteria for ADHD (p. 38). Oppositional defiant disorder. Multiple examples of negativistic behavior persist for at least 6 months (p. 380). Conduct disorder. A child persistently violates rules or the rights of others (p. 381). Disorders of Eating, Sleeping, and Elimination Pica. The patient eats material that is not food (p. 288). Rumination disorder. There is persistent regurgitation and chewing of food already eaten (p. 289). Encopresis. At age 4 years or later, the patient repeatedly passes feces into clothing or onto the floor (p. 294). Enuresis. At age 5 years or later, there is repeated voiding of urine (it can be voluntary or involuntary) into bedding or clothing (p. 293). Non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder, sleep terror type. During the first part of the night, these patients cry out in apparent fear. Often they don\u2019t really wake up at all.

This behavior is considered pathological only in adults, not children (p. 333). Other Disorders or Conditions That Begin in the Developmental Period Parent\u2013child relational problem. This Z-code is used when there is no mental disorder, but a child and parent have problems getting along (for example, overprotection or inconsistent discipline) (p. 589). Sibling relational problem. This Z-code is used for difficulties between siblings (p. 590). Quick Guide to the Neurodevelopmental Disorders 19 Problems related to abuse or neglect. A variety of Z-codes can be used to cover difficulties that arise from neglect or from physical or sexual abuse of children (p. 594). Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A child\u2019s mood is persistently negative between severe temper outbursts (p. 149). Separation anxiety disorder. The patient becomes anxious when apart from parent or home (p. 188). Posttraumatic stress disorder in preschool children. Children repeatedly relive a severely traumatic event, such as car accidents, natural disasters, or war (p. 223). Gender dysphoria in children. A boy or girl wants to be of the other gender (p. 374). Factitious disorder imposed on another. A caregiver induces symptoms in someone else, usually a child, with no intention of material gain (p. 269). Other specified (or unspecified) neurodevelopmental disorder. These categories serve for patients whose difficulties don\u2019t fulfill criteria for one of the above disorders (pp. 53\u201354). Autism and Intellectual Disability Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) Individuals with intellectual disability (ID), formerly called mental retardation, have two sorts of problems, one resulting from the other. First, there\u2019s a fundamental deficit in their ability to think. This will be some combination of problems with abstract think- ing, judgment, planning, problem solving, reasoning, and general learning (whether from academic study or from experience). Their overall intelligence level, as deter - mined by a standard individual test (not one of the group tests, which tend to be less accurate), will be markedly below average. In practical terms, this generally means an IQ of less than 70. (For infants, you can only subjectively judge intellectual functioning.) Most people with such a deficit need special help to cope. This need defines the other major requirement for diagnosis: The patient\u2019s ability to adapt to the demands of normal life\u2014in school, at",
    "generally means an IQ of less than 70. (For infants, you can only subjectively judge intellectual functioning.) Most people with such a deficit need special help to cope. This need defines the other major requirement for diagnosis: The patient\u2019s ability to adapt to the demands of normal life\u2014in school, at work, at home with family\u2014must be impaired in some important way. We can break down adaptive functioning into three areas: (1) the con - ceptual, which depends on language, math, reading, writing, reasoning, and memory to solve problems; (2) the social, which includes deploying such abilities as empathy, communication, awareness of the experiences of other people, social judgment, and self- regulation; and (3) the practical, which includes regulating behavior, organizing tasks, managing finances, and managing personal care and recreation. How well these adaptations succeed depends on the patient\u2019s education, job training, motivation, per - sonality, support from significant others, and of course intelligence level. 20 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS By definition, ID begins during the developmental years (childhood and adoles - cence). Of course, in most instances the onset is at the very beginning of this period\u2014 usually in infancy, often even before birth. If the behavior begins at age 18 or after, it is often called a major neurocognitive disorder (dementia); of course, dementia and ID can coexist. Diagnostic assessment must be done with caution, especially in younger children who may have other problems that interfere with accurate assessment. Some of these patients, once they have overcome, for example, sensory impairments of hear- ing or vision, will no longer appear intellectually challenged. Various behavioral problems are commonly associated with ID, but they don\u2019t constitute criteria for diagnosis. Among them are aggression, dependency, impulsiv - ity, passivity, self- injury, stubbornness, low self- esteem, and poor frustration tolerance. Gullibility and na\u00efvet\u00e9 can lead to risk for exploitation by others. Some patients with ID also suffer from mood disorders (which often go undiagnosed), psychotic disorders, poor attention span, and hyperactivity. However, many others are placid, loving, pleas- ant people whom others find enjoyable to live and associate with. Although many patients with ID appear normal, others have physical characteris- tics that seem obvious, even to the untrained observer. These include short stature, sei- zures, hemangiomas, and malformed eyes, ears, and other parts of the face. A diagnosis of ID is likely to be made earlier when there are associated physical abnormalities (such as",
    "appear normal, others have physical characteris- tics that seem obvious, even to the untrained observer. These include short stature, sei- zures, hemangiomas, and malformed eyes, ears, and other parts of the face. A diagnosis of ID is likely to be made earlier when there are associated physical abnormalities (such as those associated with Down syndrome). ID affects about 1% of the general popula - tion. Males outnumber females roughly 3:2. The many causes of ID include genetic abnormalities, chemical effects, structural brain damage, inborn errors of metabolism, and childhood disease. An individual\u2019s ID may have biological or social causes, or both. Some of these etiologies (with the approxi- mate percentages of all patients with ID they represent) are given below: Genetic causes (about 5%). Chromosomal abnormalities, Tay\u2013Sachs, tuberous sclerosis. Early pregnancy factors (about 30%). Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), maternal substance use, infections. Later pregnancy and perinatal factors (about 10%). Prematurity, anoxia, birth trauma, fetal malnutrition. Acquired childhood physical conditions (about 5%). Lead poisoning, infections, trauma. Environmental influences and mental disorders (about 20%). Cultural depriva - tion, early-onset schizophrenia. No identifiable cause (about 30%). Though measurement of intelligence no longer figures in the official DSM-5 crite- ria, in the prototypes below I have included IQ ranges to provide some anchoring for Intellectual Disability 21 the several severity specifiers. However, remember that adaptive functioning, not some number on a page, is what determines the actual diagnosis given to any individual. Even individually administered Iq tests will have a few points of error. That\u2019s one reason why patients with measured Iqs as high as 75 can sometimes be diagnosed as having ID: They still have problems with adaptive functioning that help define the condition. On the other hand, an occasional person with an Iq of less than 70 may function well enough not to qualify for this diagnosis. In addition, cultural differences, illness, and mental set can all affect the accuracy of Iq testing. Interpretation of Iq scores also must consider the possibility of scatter (better perfor- mance on verbal tests than on performance tests, or vice versa), as well as physical, cul- tural, and emotional disabilities. These factors are not easy to judge; some test batteries may require the help of a skilled psychometrist. Such factors are among the reasons why definitions of ID have moved away from relying solely on the results of Iq testing. Essential Features of Intellectual Disability From",

Such factors are among the reasons why definitions of ID have moved away from relying solely on the results of Iq testing. Essential Features of Intellectual Disability From their earliest years, people with ID are in cognitive trouble. Actually, it\u2019s trouble of two sorts. First, as assessed both clinically and with formal testing, they have dif - ficulty with cognitive tasks such as reasoning, making plans, thinking in the abstract, making judgments, and learning from formal studies or from life\u2019s experiences. Both clinical judgment and the results of one-on-one intelligence tests are required to assess intellectual functioning. Second, their cognitive impairment leads to difficulty adapting their behavior so that they can become citizens who are independent and socially accountable. These problems occur in communication, social interaction, and practical living skills. To one degree or another, depending on severity, they affect the patient across multiple life areas\u2014family, school, work, and social relations. F70 [317] Mild. As children, these individuals learn slowly and lag behind school - mates, though they can be expected to attain roughly sixth-grade academic skills by the time they are grown. As they mature, deficiencies in judgment and solving prob- lems cause them to require extra help managing everyday situations\u2014and personal relationships may suffer. They usually need help with such tasks as paying their bills, shopping for groceries, and finding appropriate accommodations. However, many work independently, though at jobs that require relatively little cognitive involve - ment. Though memory and the ability to use language can be quite good, these patients become lost when confronted with metaphor or other examples of abstract thinking. IQ typically ranges from 50 to 70. They constitute 85% of all patients with ID. 22 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS F71 [318.0] Moderate. When they are small children, these individuals\u2019 differences from nonaffected peers are marked and encompassing. Though they can learn to read, to do simple math, and to handle money, language use is slow to develop and relatively simple. Far more than mildly affected individuals do, in early life they need help in learning to provide their own self-care and engage in household tasks. Relationships with others (even romantic ones) are possible, though they often don\u2019t recognize the cues that govern ordinary personal interaction. Although they require assistance making decisions, they may",

Relationships with others (even romantic ones) are possible, though they often don\u2019t recognize the cues that govern ordinary personal interaction. Although they require assistance making decisions, they may be able to work (with help from supervisors and co- workers) at relatively undemanding jobs, typically at sheltered workshops. IQ will range from the high 30s to low 50s. They represent about 10% of all patients with ID. F72 [318.1] Severe. Though these people may learn simple commands or instructions, communication skills are rudimentary (single words, some phrases). Under supervi - sion, they may be able to perform simple jobs. They can maintain personal relation- ships with relatives, but require supervision for all activities; they even need help dressing and with personal hygiene. IQs are in the low 20s to high 30s. They make up roughly 5% of the total of all patients with ID. F73 [318.2] Profound. With limited speech and only rudimentary capacity for social interaction, much of what these individuals communicate may be through gestures. They rely completely on other people for their needs, including activities of daily living, though they may help with simple chores. Profound ID usually results from a serious neurological disorder, which often carries with it sensory or motor disabilities. IQ ranges from the low 20s downward. About 1\u20132% of all patients with ID are so profoundly affected.

Grover Peary Grover Peary was born when his mother was only 15. She was an obese girl who hadn\u2019t even realized she was pregnant until she was 6 months along. Even then, she hadn\u2019t bothered to seek prenatal care. Born after 30 hours of hard labor, Grover hadn\u2019t breathed right away. After the delivery, his mother had lost interest in him; he had been reared alternately by his grandmother and an aunt. Intellectual Disability 23 Grover walked at 20 months; he spoke his first words at age 2\u00bd years.

A pediatri - cian pronounced him \u201csomewhat slow,\u201d so his grandmother enrolled him in an infant school for children with developmental disabilities. At the age of 7, he had done well enough to be mainstreamed in his local elementary school. Throughout the remainder of his school career, he worked with a special education teacher for 2 hours each day; otherwise, he attended regular classes. Testing when he was in the 4th and 10th grades placed his IQ at 70 and 72, respectively. Despite his disability, Grover loved school. He had learned to read by the time he was 8, and he spent much of his free time poring over books about geography and natural science. (He had a great deal of free time, especially at recess and lunch hour. He was clumsy and physically undersized, and the other children routinely excluded him from their games.) At one time he wanted to become a geologist, but he was steered toward a general curriculum. He lived in a county that provided special education and training for individuals with ID, so by the time he graduated, he had learned some manual skills and could navigate the complicated local public transportation. A job coach helped him to find work washing dishes at a restaurant in a downtown hotel and to learn the skills necessary to maintain the job. The restaurant manager got him a room in the hotel basement. The waitresses at the restaurant often gave Grover a few quarters out of their tips. Living at the hotel, he didn\u2019t need much money\u2014his room and food were covered, and the tiny dish room where he worked didn\u2019t require much of a wardrobe. He spent most of his money on expanding his CD collection and going to baseball games. His aunt, who saw him every week, helped him with grooming and reminded him to shave. She and her husband also took him to the ball park; otherwise, he would have spent nearly all of his free time in his room, listening to music and reading magazines. When Grover was 28, an earthquake hit the city where he lived. The hotel was so badly damaged that it closed with no notice at all. Thrown out of work, all of Grover\u2019s fellow employees were",
    "all of his free time in his room, listening to music and reading magazines. When Grover was 28, an earthquake hit the city where he lived. The hotel was so badly damaged that it closed with no notice at all. Thrown out of work, all of Grover\u2019s fellow employees were too busy taking care of their own families to think about him. His aunt was out of town on vacation; he had nowhere to turn. It was summertime, so he placed the few possessions he had rescued in a heavy-duty lawn and leaf bag and walked the streets until he grew tired; he then rolled out some blankets in the park. He slept this way for nearly 2 weeks, eating what he could scrounge from other camp- ers. Although federal emergency relief workers had been sent to help those hit by the earthquake, Grover did not request relief. Finally, a park ranger recognized his plight and referred him to the clinic. During that first interview, Grover\u2019s shaggy hair and thin face gave him the appear- ance of someone much older. Dressed in a soiled shirt and baggy pants\u2014they appeared to be someone\u2019s castoff\u2014he sat still in his chair and gave poor eye contact. He spoke hesitantly at first, but he was clear and coherent, and eventually communicated quite well with the interviewer. (Much of the information given above, however, was obtained later from old school records and from his aunt upon her return from vacation.) Grover\u2019s mood was surprisingly good, about medium in quality. He smiled when 24 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS he talked about his aunt, but looked serious when he was asked where he was going to stay. He had no delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, compulsions, or phobias. He denied having any panic attacks, though he admitted he felt \u201csorta worried\u201d when he had to sleep in the park. Grover scored 25 out of 30 on the Mini- Mental State Exam. He was oriented except to day and month; he spent a great deal of effort subtracting sevens, and finally got two correct. He was able to recall three objects after 5 minutes, and managed a perfect score on the language section. He recognized that he had a problem with where to live, but, aside from asking his aunt when she returned, he hadn\u2019t the slightest idea how to go about solving the problem.

He recognized that he had a problem with where to live, but, aside from asking his aunt when she returned, he hadn\u2019t the slightest idea how to go about solving the problem. Evaluation of Grover Peary Had Grover been evaluated before the hotel closed, he might not have fulfilled the cri- teria for ID. At that time he had a place to live, food to eat, and activities to occupy him. However, his aunt had to remind him about shaving and staying presentable. Despite low scores on at least two IQ tests (criterion A in DSM-5), he was functioning pretty well in a highly, if informally, structured environment. Once his support system quite literally collapsed, Grover could not cope with change. He didn\u2019t make use of the resources available to others who had lost their homes. He was also unable to find work; only through the generosity of others did he manage even to eat\u2014a pretty clear deficit of adaptive functioning (B). Of course, his condition had existed since early childhood (C). Therefore, despite the fact that his IQ had hovered in the low 70s, he seemed impaired enough to warrant a diagnosis of ID. (Note that, as an alternative, Grover would also comfortably match the prototype for mild ID.) The differential diagnosis of ID includes a variety of learning and communication disorders, which are presented later in this chapter. Dementia, or major neurocogni- tive disorder in DSM-5, would have been diagnosed if Grover\u2019s problem with cognition had represented a marked decline from his previous level of functioning. (Dementia and ID sometimes coexist, though they can be difficult to discriminate.) At his IQ level, Grover might have been diagnosed as having borderline intellectual functioning had he not had such obvious difficulties in coping with life. Youngsters and adults with ID often have associated mental disorders, which include attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder; these conditions can be diagnosed concurrently. Mood and anxiety disorders are often pres- ent, though clinicians may not recognize them without adequate collateral information. Personality traits such as stubbornness are also sometimes concomitant. Patients with ID may have physical conditions such as epilepsy and cerebral palsy . Patients with Down syndrome may be at special risk for developing major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease as they approach their 40s. Adding in his homelessness",

The various editions of the DSM have recorded more than 200 changes in the names of mental disorders (a figure that doesn\u2019t even include new disorders added over the years). but the case of ID may be the only time that the name of a mental disorder was changed pursuant to an act of congress. During the 2009\u20132010 legislative session, congress approved, and President Obama signed, a statute replacing in law the term mental retardation with intellectual disability . The inspiration was Rosa Marcellino, a 9-year-old girl with Down syndrome who, with her parents and siblings, worked to expunge the words mentally retarded from the health and education codes in Maryland, her home state. note further that the term developmental disability as it is used in law is not restricted to people with ID. The legal term applies to anyone who by age 22 has permanent problems functioning in at least three areas because of mental or physical impairment. F88 [315.8] Global Developmental Delay Use the category of global developmental delay for a patient under age 5 years who has not been adequately evaluated. Such a child may have delayed developmental mile - stones. F79 [319] Unspecified Intellectual Disability Use the category of unspecified ID for a patient 5 years of age or older who has addi - tional disabilities (blindness, severe mental disorder) too severe to allow full evaluation of intellectual abilities. F84.0 [299.00] Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with widely varying degrees and manifestations that has both genetic and environmental causes.

    "causes. Usually recognized in early childhood, it continues through to adult life, though the form may be greatly modified by experience and education. The symptoms fall into three broad categories (DSM-5 lumps together the first two). Communication. Despite normal hearing, the speech of patients with ASD may be delayed by as much as several years. Their deficits vary greatly in scope and sever- ity, from what we used to call Asperger\u2019s disorder (these people can speak clearly 26 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS and have normal, even superior, intelligence) to patients so severely affected that they can hardly communicate at all. Others may show unusual speech patterns and idiosyncratic use of phrases. They may speak too loudly or lack the prosody (lilt) that supplies the music of normal speech. They may also fail to use body language or other nonverbal behavior to communicate\u2014for example, the smiles or head nods with which most of us express approval. They may not understand the basis of humor (the concept that the words people use can have multiple or abstract mean- ings, for instance). Autistic children often have trouble beginning or sustaining conversation; rather, they may talk to themselves or hold monologues on subjects that interest them, but not other people. They tend to ask questions over and again, even after they\u2019ve obtained repeated answers. Socialization. The social maturation of patients with ASD occurs more slowly than for normal children, and developmental phases may occur out of the expected sequence. Parents often become concerned in the second 6 months, when their child doesn\u2019t make eye contact, smile reciprocally, or cuddle; instead, the baby will arch away from a parent\u2019s embrace and stare into space. Toddlers don\u2019t point to objects or play with other children. They may not stretch out their arms to be picked up or show the normal anxiety at separation from parents. Perhaps as a result of frustration at the inability to communicate, ASD often results in tantrums and aggression in young children. With little apparent requirement for closeness, older children have few friends and seem not to share their joys or sorrows with other people. In adolescence and beyond, this can play out as a nearly absent need for sex. Motor behavior. The motor milestones of patients with ASD usually arrive on time; it\u2019s the types of behavior they choose that mark them as different. These include compulsive or ritualistic actions (called stereotypies",
    "other people. In adolescence and beyond, this can play out as a nearly absent need for sex. Motor behavior. The motor milestones of patients with ASD usually arrive on time; it\u2019s the types of behavior they choose that mark them as different. These include compulsive or ritualistic actions (called stereotypies )\u2014twirling, rocking, hand flapping, head banging, and maintaining odd body postures. They suck on toys or spin them rather than using them as symbols for imaginative play. Their restricted interests lead them to be preoccupied with parts of objects. They tend to resist change, preferring to adhere rigidly to routine. They may appear indiffer- ent to pain or extremes of temperature; they may be preoccupied with smelling or touching things. Many such patients injure themselves by head banging, skin picking, or other repetitive motions. Apart from the subtype formerly known as Asperger\u2019s disorder, ASD wasn\u2019t recog- nized at all until Leo Kanner introduced the term early infantile autism in 1943. Since then, the concept has expanded in scope and grown new subdivisions (DSM-IV listed four types plus the ubiquitous not otherwise specified ), though it has now contracted again into the unified concept presented by DSM-5. Although the degree of disability varies widely, the effect upon the lives of most patients and their families is profound and enduring. ASD is often associated with intellectual disability; discriminating these two dis - Autism Spectrum Disorder 27 orders can be difficult. Sensory abnormalities occur in perhaps 90% of patients with ASD; some children hate bright lights or loud sounds, or even the prickly texture of certain fabrics or other surfaces. A small minority have cognitive \u201csplinter\u201d skills\u2014 special abilities in computation, music, or rote memory that occasionally rise to the level of savantism. Physical conditions associated with ASD include phenylketonuria, fragile X syn - drome, tuberous sclerosis, and a history of perinatal distress. Mental health comor - bidity issues include anxiety disorders (especially prevalent) and depression (2\u201330%), obsessive\u2013 compulsive behavior (in about one-third), attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (over half), intellectual disability (about half), and seizures (25\u201350%). Some patients complain of initial insomnia or a reduced need for sleep; a few even sleep days and remain awake nights. Researchers have recently reported an association of a form of autism with a gene responsible for kidney, breast, colon, brain, and skin cancer. Incorporating the former diagnoses of autistic, Rett\u2019s, Asperger\u2019s, and childhood disintegrative disorders, ASD\u2019s overall",

Researchers have recently reported an association of a form of autism with a gene responsible for kidney, breast, colon, brain, and skin cancer. Incorporating the former diagnoses of autistic, Rett\u2019s, Asperger\u2019s, and childhood disintegrative disorders, ASD\u2019s overall prevalence is about 6 per 1,000 children in the general population; some studies report even higher figures. And the numbers have increased in recent years, at least in part due to increased awareness of ASD. Autism affects all cultural and socioeconomic groups. Although boys are twice (perhaps up to four times) as often affected as girls, the latter are more likely to be severely affected. (The former Asperger\u2019s disorder, it should be said, is more heavily weighted toward girls.) Siblings of patients with ASD have a greatly elevated risk for the same disorder. note that a SD\u2019s impressive range of severity can be reflected in separate ratings for the social communication and behavioral components. Though the DSM-5 definitions for severity levels are a bit fussy, they boil down to mild , moderate, and severe. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve listed them, but DSM-5 hasn\u2019t for a practical reason: Some members of the commit - tee that wrote the criteria worried that a label of mild could give an insurance company leverage to deny services. Of course, that reasoning could cover just about any disorder in the book. Essential Features of Autism Spectrum Disorder From early childhood, contact with others affects to some extent nearly every aspect of how these patients function. Social relationships vary from mild impairment to almost complete lack of interaction. There may be just a reduced sharing of inter - ests and experiences, though some patients fail utterly to initiate or respond to the approach of others. They tend to speak with few of the usual physical signals most people use\u2014eye contact, hand gestures, smiles, and nods. Relationships with other people founder, so that patients with ASD have trouble adapting their behavior to 28 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS different social situations; they may lack general interest in other people and make few, if any, friends. Repetition and narrow focus characterize their activities and interests. They resist even small changes in their routines (perhaps demanding exactly the same menu every lunchtime or endlessly repeating already- answered questions).

They may be fascinated with movement (such as spinning) or small parts of objects. The reac - tion to stimuli (pain, loud sounds, extremes of temperature) may be either feeble or excessive. Some are unusually preoccupied with sensory experiences: They are fas - cinated by visual movement or particular smells, or they sometimes fear or reject certain sounds or the feel of certain fabrics. They may use peculiar speech or show stereotypies of behavior such as hand flapping, body rocking, or echolalia. The Fine Print Note that there are varying degrees of ASD, some of which received separate diag - noses and codes in DSM-IV but no longer do. In particular, what was formerly called Asperger\u2019s disorder is relatively milder; many of these people communicate verbally quite well, yet still lack the other skills needed to form social bonds with others.

Her life story serves as an inspiration for patients, for their families, and for all of us who would offer help. The following information, intended not to present a full picture of her life but to illustrate the features of ASD, has been abstracted from several of her own books. Born in 1947, Temple began walking shortly after her first birthday. Even as a tod- dler, she didn\u2019t like to be picked up, and would stiffen when her mother tried to hold her. In her autobiographies, she recalls that she would sit and rock for long periods; rocking and spinning helped calm her when she felt overstimulated. Much later, she remembered that being touched by other people caused such sensory overload that she would struggle to escape; hugging was \u201ctoo overwhelming.\u201d She couldn\u2019t even tolerate the feel of edges of clothing, such as seams of her underwear. Temple was alert and well coordinated, and she had normal hearing; yet she didn\u2019t speak until after her fourth birthday. Later, she recalled her frustration at understand- ing what was said but being unable to respond. For many years thereafter, her voice was toneless and uninflected, without lilt or rhythm. Even as a college student, she would speak too loudly, unaware of the effect her voice was having on others. As a small child, Temple was taken to a psychiatrist who diagnosed her as having \u201cchildhood schizophrenia\u201d; her parents were advised that she might need institution - alization. Instead, she was given the benefit of private schooling, where her teachers taught the other students to accept her\u2014and her eccentricities. For example, she was unable to meet the gaze of others and lacked the sense of feelings attached to personal relationships. She would even hold a cat too tightly, not recognizing the",
    "given the benefit of private schooling, where her teachers taught the other students to accept her\u2014and her eccentricities. For example, she was unable to meet the gaze of others and lacked the sense of feelings attached to personal relationships. She would even hold a cat too tightly, not recognizing the signals of distress it was giving her. With no interest in playing with other children, she would instead sit and spin objects such as coins or the lids of cans 30 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS or bottles. She had an intense interest in odors, and was fascinated by bright colors and the movement of sliding doors and other objects. Sameness was balm for her. At school age, she resisted change in her routines and would repeatedly ask the same questions. She reacted badly to Christmas and Thanksgiving, because they entailed so much noise and confusion. As an older child, she became fixated on particular issues such as elections\u2014the campaign buttons, bum- per stickers, and posters for the governor of her state held special interest for Temple. But emotional nuance escaped her. With no internal compass for navigating per - sonal relationships, understanding normal social communication was, for her, like being \u201can anthropologist on Mars.\u201d Because she didn\u2019t have the feelings normal people attach to others, her social interactions had to be guided by intellect, not emotion. To commu- nicate, she would use lines scripted in advance, because she didn\u2019t have the instinct to speak in a socially appropriate manner. What she has learned of empathy was attained by visualizing herself in the other person\u2019s place. Although Temple had always rejected human contact, she nonetheless craved com- fort. She found it one summer she spent on a farm, after observing that a device used to hold cattle so that they could be immunized appeared to calm them. As a result, she designed and built a squeezing machine that applied mechanical pressure to her own body; the result was tranquility she hadn\u2019t found by other means. Refined over the years, her invention led to her eventual career in creating devices used in animal husbandry. As an adult, Temple still had trouble responding to unexpected social situations, and she would have severe panic attacks were they not controlled with a small dose of the antidepressant imipramine.

As an adult, Temple still had trouble responding to unexpected social situations, and she would have severe panic attacks were they not controlled with a small dose of the antidepressant imipramine. But she became salutatorian of her college graduating class; eventually she earned a PhD and ran her own company. She is world- famous as a designer of machinery that helps calm animals on their road to slaughter. And she is a sought-after speaker on autism. But if someone\u2019s pager or cell phone goes off when she\u2019s giving a lecture, it still causes her to lose her train of thought. Evaluation of Temple Grandin Temple\u2019s books (and the HBO film named for her) provide a treasure trove of data bear- ing on the diagnosis of ASD. However, it would be better if we had had multiple sources of information\u2014for her, as for any patient. I\u2019ll just touch on the basic material we\u2019d use for diagnosis. Working our way through the diagnostic criteria, I think we can agree, first of all, that she has had persistent problems in social interaction and communication (criterion A). They include social and emotional reciprocity (didn\u2019t want/need to be hugged\u2014A1); use of nonverbal behaviors (poor eye contact\u2014A2); and relationships (lacking interest in other children\u2014A3). Although the DSM-5 criteria are not carefully worded, there must be deficits in each of these three areas for a person to be diagnosed as having ASD. That reading brings DSM-5 fully in line with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder. Autism Spectrum Disorder 31 Temple\u2019s restricted behavior and interests included examples of all four symptoms in the criterion B category (only two are required for diagnosis): stereotyped spinning of coins and other objects (she even twirled herself\u2014B1); a rejection of change in rou- tine (dislike of holiday festivities\u2014B2); fixed, restricted interests in, for example, sliding doors and the paraphernalia of political campaigns (B3); and hyperreactivity to sounds and fascination with smells (B4). Temple\u2019s symptoms were present from early childhood (C); her biography and other books richly document the degree to which they domi - nated and impaired her everyday functioning (D). However, she eventually surmounted them brilliantly, thereby disposing of the final possible objection (E) that the symptoms must not be better accounted for by intellectual disability. Patients with stereotypic movement disorder will exhibit motor behaviors that do not fulfill an obvious function, but the criteria for that diagnosis",
    "functioning (D). However, she eventually surmounted them brilliantly, thereby disposing of the final possible objection (E) that the symptoms must not be better accounted for by intellectual disability. Patients with stereotypic movement disorder will exhibit motor behaviors that do not fulfill an obvious function, but the criteria for that diagnosis specifically exclude ASD. Temple spoke late and had difficulty communicating verbally, but the criteria for social communication disorder also exclude ASD. Her parents were supportive and sensitive to her needs, eliminating severe psychosocial deprivation as a possible etiol- ogy. We\u2019d also need to consider general medical problems such as a hearing deficit, which Temple herself explicitly denies having. She does have a history of severe anxiety, well controlled with medication, that would probably qualify for a comorbid diagnosis of panic disorder , though it cannot account for the vast majority of her past symptoms. (I\u2019m leaving the details of that diag- nosis as an exercise.) Although some aspects of her history are reminiscent of obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, she has many other symptoms that it cannot explain, either. Besides panic and other anxiety disorders, ASD can be comorbid with intellectual disability, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental coordination disor - der, specific learning disorders, and mood disorders. I\u2019d judge Temple\u2019s childhood GAF score as about 55. Though today she may no longer meet DSM-5\u2019s diagnostic standards, she clearly did as a child, permitting us to list her diagnosis then as follows: F84.0 [299.00] Autism spectrum disorder F41.0 [300.01] Panic disorder With the elimination of a sperger\u2019s disorder (and other specific autism diagnoses) from DSM-5, patient support groups have been up in arms. a sperger\u2019s disorder, used since 1944, has a history as extensive as autism. It seemed to define a group of people who, though clearly burdened by their symptoms, also possess a sometimes remarkable intelligence and range of capabilities that may even be superior. It\u2019s tempting to regard asperger\u2019s as a sort of \u201cautism lite.\u201d However, that would be a mistake, for patients with asperger\u2019s have many of the same deficits as do other individuals with aSD. Perhaps desir- ing friends, but lacking the empathy necessary for normal social interaction, these solitary individuals might like to change but have no idea how to go about it. So useful has the concept of asperger\u2019s been, and so ingrained in the common usage 32 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS of patients and professionals alike has it",

So useful has the concept of asperger\u2019s been, and so ingrained in the common usage 32 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS of patients and professionals alike has it become, that it seems unlikely to disappear\u2014 even though it hasn\u2019t been blessed by the latest DSM. It is an irony that because of her language delay, DSM-IV criteria would have deemed Temple Grandin ineligible for a diag - nosis of a sperger\u2019s, though she remains the poster person for that diagnosis. This is a great example in support of the prototype- matching method of diagnosis I have described in the Introduction (p. 2). Using it, I\u2019d rate Temple (when she was a child) a 4 out of 5 for the diagnosis of asperger\u2019s disorder. However, DSM-5, in a nod to vehement objections from the community of patients with asperger\u2019s, does state that those who were formerly diagnosed as asperger\u2019s can now be regarded as having a SD, whether or not they meet current criteria. That\u2019s the second irony in one paragraph. Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has borne a long string of names since it was first described in 1902. Though it is one of the most common behavioral disorders of childhood, only recently\u2014within a few decades, at most\u2014have we recognized the persistence of ADHD symptoms into adult life. Although this disorder usually isn\u2019t diagnosed until the age of 9, symptoms typi - cally begin before a child starts school. (DSM-5 criteria require some symptoms before age 12.) Parents sometimes report that their children with ADHD cried more than their other babies, that they were colicky or irritable, or that they slept less. Some moth- ers will even swear that these children kicked more before they were born. Developmental milestones may occur early; these children may be described as running almost before they could walk. \u201cMotorically driven,\u201d they have trouble just sitting quietly. They may also be clumsy and have problems with coordination. At least one study found that they require more emergency care for injuries and accidental poisonings than children without ADHD do. They often cannot focus on schoolwork; therefore, though intelligence is usually normal, they may perform poorly in school. They tend to be impulsive, to say things that hurt the feelings of others, and",
    "found that they require more emergency care for injuries and accidental poisonings than children without ADHD do. They often cannot focus on schoolwork; therefore, though intelligence is usually normal, they may perform poorly in school. They tend to be impulsive, to say things that hurt the feelings of others, and to be unpopular. They may be so unhappy that they also fulfill criteria for persistent depres- sive disorder (dysthymia). These behaviors usually decrease with adolescence, when many patients with ADHD settle down and become normally active and capable students. But some use substances or develop other forms of delinquent behavior. Adults may have continu - ing interpersonal problems, alcohol or drug use, or personality disorders. Adults may also complain of trouble with concentration, disorganization, impulsivity, mood lability, overactivity, quick temper, and intolerance of stress. Until recently, ADHD was said to affect perhaps 6% of children in the United States, with a male preponderance ratio of 2:1 or greater. A (disputed) 2013 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the rate at closer to 11% of Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 33 high school boys. The DSM-5 criteria identify perhaps 2.5% of adults age 17 and over, though the range reported in various studies is great. The male\u2013female ratio is far less among adults, for reasons that are obscure. The condition tends to run in families: Parents and siblings are more likely than average to be affected. Alcoholism and divorce, as well as other causes of family disrup- tion, are common in the family backgrounds of these people. There may be a genetic association with antisocial personality disorder and somatic symptom disorder. Also associated with ADHD are learning disorders, especially problems with reading. In adults, look for substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders. Several other disorders are likely to co-occur with ADHD. These include oppo - sitional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, each of which will be present in a sub - stantial minority of patients with ADHD. A newly devised condition, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, may be even more strongly associated. Also look for specific learning disorders, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, and tic disorders. Adults may have antisocial personality disorder or a substance use problem.

Essential Features of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Teachers often notice and refer for evaluation these children, who are forever in motion, disrupting class by their restlessness or fidgeting, jumping out of their seats, talking endlessly, interrupting others, seeming unable to take turns or to play quietly. In fact, hyperactivity is only half the story. These children also have difficulty paying attention and maintaining focus on their work or play\u2014the inattentive part of the story. Readily distracted (and therefore disliking and avoiding sustained mental effort such as homework), they neglect details and therefore make careless errors. Their poor organization skills result in lost assignments or other materials and an inability to follow through with chores or appointments. These behaviors invade many aspects of their lives, including school, family rela- tions, and social life away from home. Although the behaviors may be somewhat modified with increasing age, they may accompany these individuals through the teen years and beyond.

Denis Tourney \u201cI think I\u2019ve got what my son has.\u201d Denis Tourney was a 37-year-old married man who worked as a research chemist. Throughout his life, Denis had had trouble focusing his attention on any task at hand. Because he was bright and personable, he had been able to overcome his handicap and succeed at his job for a major pharmaceutical manufacturer. At home one evening the week before this appointment, Denis had been working on plans for a new chemical synthesis. His wife and children were in bed and it was quiet, but he had been having an unusually hard time keeping his mind on his work. Everything seemed to distract him\u2014the ticking of the clock, the cat jumping up onto Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 35 the table. Besides, his head was beginning to pound, so he grabbed what he thought were two aspirin tablets and washed them down with a glass of milk. \u201cWhat happened next seemed like magic,\u201d he told the clinician. \u201cIt was as if some- body had put my brain waves through a funnel and squirted them onto the paper I was working on. Within half an hour I had shut out everything but my work. In 2 hours I accomplished what would ordinarily take a day or more to get done. Then I got suspi - cious and looked at the pill bottle. I had taken two of the tablets that were prescribed last month for Randy.\u201d Denis\u2019s son was 8, and until a month ago he had been considered the terror of the second grade. But after 4 weeks on Ritalin, he had seemed less driven; his grades had improved; and he had become \u201calmost a pleasure to live with.\u201d For years, Denis had suspected that he himself might have been hyperactive as a child.

Like Randy, during the first few grades of elementary school he had been unable to sit still in his seat\u2014 bouncing up to use the pencil sharpener or to watch a passing ambulance. His teacher had once written a note home complaining that he talked con- stantly and that he \u201csquirmed like a bug on a griddle.\u201d It was part of the family mythol- ogy that he had \u201ccrawled at 8 months, run at 10.\u201d On questioning, Denis admitted that as a kid he was always on the go and could hardly tolerate waiting his turn for anything (\u201cI felt like I was going to climb right out of my skin\u201d). He was almost stupifyingly forgetful. \u201cStill am. I really can\u2019t recall much else about my attention span when I was a kid\u2014it was too long ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have the gen- eral impression that I didn\u2019t listen very well, just like I am today. Except when I took those two pills by mistake.\u201d The remainder of Denis\u2019s evaluation was unremarkable. His physical health was excellent, and he had had no other mental health problems. Apart from some fidgeting in his chair, his appearance was unremarkable. His speech and affect were both com - pletely normal, and he earned a perfect score on the Mini- Mental State Exam. Denis had been born in Ceylon, where his parents were both stationed as career diplomats with the foreign service. His father drank himself into an early grave, but not before divorcing his mother when their only child was 7 or 8. Because it concerned him, Denis vividly remembered their last major argument. His mother had pleaded to have Denis\u2019s problems evaluated, but his father had banged his fist and sworn that no kid of his was \u201cgoing to see some damn shrink.\u201d Not long afterwards, his parents split up. Denis felt he had learned a lot from his father\u2019s example\u2014he didn\u2019t drink, had never tried drugs, didn\u2019t argue with his wife, and had readily agreed when she sug - gested having Randy evaluated. \u201cYou always dream that your kids will have what you never did,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our case, it\u2019s Ritalin.\u201d Evaluation of Denis Tourney As a",

It was easiest for him to remember the problems relating to his activity level (the A2 criteria). Those included 36 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS the childhood symptoms of squirming (A2a), inability to remain seated (A2b) or wait his turn (A2h), always being on the go (A2e), excessive running (A2c), and excessive talking (A2f). (For children, DSM-5 requires six of these symptom\u2014but, because they tend to be poorly remembered years later, only five for patients age 17 and above. The same numbers and rationale hold for symptoms of inattention.) Denis also thought that he had had problems with his attention span, though he was less clear about the exact symptoms. These symptoms were present when Denis was a small child, certainly before age 12 (B); we have only anecdotal \u201cclear evidence\u201d that they interfered with the quality of his work, but at this remove, it would seem to be enough. His clinician should ascer - tain that he had had difficulties in more than one setting (such as school and at home;, C). But even three decades later, he remembered enough hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms to justify the childhood diagnosis. As adults, many such patients recognize restlessness as their predominant symptom. It would be a good idea for the clinician to verify what Denis thought he remembered, perhaps by obtaining old school records. In children, a number of other conditions make up the differential diagnosis. (Note that in a clinician\u2019s office, many children with ADHD are able to sit still and focus attention well; the diagnosis often hinges on the history.) Those with intellectual dis - ability learn slowly and may be overly active and impulsive, but patients with ADHD, once their attention is captured, are able to learn normally. Unlike children with autism spectrum disorder, patients with ADHD communicate normally. Depressed patients may be agitated or have a poor attention span, but the duration is not usually lifelong. Many patients with Tourette\u2019s disorder are also hyperactive, but those who only have ADHD will not show motor and vocal tics. Children reared in a chaotic social",

Many patients with Tourette\u2019s disorder are also hyperactive, but those who only have ADHD will not show motor and vocal tics. Children reared in a chaotic social environment may also have difficulty with hyperactivity and inattention; although ADHD can be diagnosed in a child who lives in an unstable social environment, the process requires extra care and thought. Other behavior disorders ( oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder) may involve behavior that runs afoul of adults or peers, but the behaviors appear purposeful and are not accompanied by the feelings of remorse typical of ADHD behavior. However, many children with ADHD have comorbid conduct, oppositional defiant, or Tourette\u2019s disorder. The differential diagnosis in adults includes antisocial personality disorder and mood disorders (patients with mood disorders can have problems with concentration and agitation). The diagnosis should not be made if the symptoms are better explained by schizophrenia, an anxiety disorder, or a personality disorder. As a child, Denis might have fulfilled criteria for ADHD, combined type; with the information currently available, however, this would be a tough sell to any hard-nosed coder. Although as an adult he continued to have severe problems concentrating, he overcame them by dint of raw intelligence. Until he compared his usual concentration to the kind of work he could do with medication, he never realized just how disabled he had been. Although we have some specifics that would constitute a current DSM-5 diagnosis Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 37 (he was distractible\u2014A1b), even with more information we might not be able to dredge up enough detail to make a full adult diagnosis by contemporary standards. As a clini - cian, I feel more comfortable with the qualifier \u201cin partial remission.\u201d A fuller examina- tion, perhaps with added information from his wife (or boss), might justify a different final diagnosis. Oh, and I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 70. F90.2 [314.01] Attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation (in partial remission) aDHD is probably underdiagnosed in adults. although some writers have expressed skep- ticism about its validity, the evidence of its legitimacy in this age range is increasing. However, the fussiness of their language makes the specifier criteria seem ripe for neglect.

See page 11 (sidebar). Tic Disorders A tic is a sudden vocalization or movement of the body that is repeated, rapid, and unrhythmic\u2014so quick, in fact, that it can occur literally in (and sometimes is) the blink of an eye. Complex tics, which may include several simple tics in quick succession, naturally take longer. Tics are common; they can occur by themselves or as symptoms of Tourette\u2019s disorder. Tics range from the occasional twitch to repetitive motor and vocal outbursts that can cluster into bouts and create utter (!) chaos in the classroom. Motor tics first appear in early childhood, sometimes as early as 2 years of age. Classically, they involve the upper part of the face (grimaces and twitching of the muscles around the eyes), though affected children can present with a wide range of symptoms that include abdominal tensing and jerking of shoulders, head, or extremities. Vocal tics tend to begin some - 38 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS what later. Simple vocal tics may include barks, coughs, throat clearing, sniffs, and single syllables that may be muttered or called out. Tics cause children to feel out of control of their own bodies and mental processes, though as they get older, some patients do develop a \u201ctension and release\u201d buildup of the urge to tic that is relieved by the tic itself\u2014not unlike what\u2019s encountered in klepto- mania.

    "that is relieved by the tic itself\u2014not unlike what\u2019s encountered in klepto- mania. Although tics are involuntary, patients can sometimes suppress them for a time; they usually disappear during sleep. Though tic disorders are described as persistent, they do change in intensity with time, perhaps disappearing entirely for weeks at a time. Frequency often increases when a person is sick, tired, or stressed. Childhood tics are common, occurring in around 10% of boys and 5% of girls. Most of these are motor tics that disappear as the child matures; usually, they don\u2019t generate enough concern to warrant an evaluation. When they persist into adulthood, the preva- lence is lower, though males still predominate. Adults rarely develop tics de novo; when it does happen, it is often in response to use of cocaine or other street drugs. The tics of adult patients tend to remain the same, varying in intensity though less severe than in childhood. Several factors contribute to a worse prognosis in an adult: comorbid mental conditions or chronic physical illness, lack of support at home, and psychoactive drug use. Because tics look pretty much the same regardless of diagnosis, I\u2019ve presented an example only in the context of Tourette\u2019s disorder. F95.2 [307.23] Tourette\u2019s Disorder Tourette\u2019s disorder (TD) was first described in 1895 by the French neurologist Georges Gilles de la Tourette. It entails many tics that affect various parts of the body. Motor tics of the head are usually present (eye blinking is often the first symptom to appear). Some patients have complex motor tics (for example, doing deep knee bends). The location and severity of motor tics in patients with TD typically change with time. But the vocal tics are what make this disorder so distinctive and bring patients to the attention of professionals\u2014often mental health clinicians rather than neurolo - gists. Vocal tics can include an astonishing variety of barks, clicks, coughs, grunts, and understandable words. A sizeable minority (10\u201330%) of patients also have coprolalia , which means that they utter obscenities or other language that can render the condition intolerable by family and acquaintances. Mental coprolalia (intrusive dirty thoughts) can also occur. Now acknowledged to be far from rare, TD affects up to 1% of young people, with males affected at two to three times the frequency of females. For unknown reasons, it is less common in African Americans than in other racial/ethnic groups. Associated",

Now acknowledged to be far from rare, TD affects up to 1% of young people, with males affected at two to three times the frequency of females. For unknown reasons, it is less common in African Americans than in other racial/ethnic groups. Associated symptoms include self- injury due to head banging and skin picking. TD is strongly familial, with concordance over 50% in monozygotic twins and 10% in dizygotic. There is often a family history of tics or obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder (OCD), so that clini- cians suspect a genetic linkage between Tourette\u2019s and early-onset OCD. Typically, TD begins by age 6; most patients reach maximum severity by ages 10\u201312, after which improvement occurs in perhaps 75%. Under 25% will continue to have tics Tourette\u2019s Disorder 39 that are moderate or worse. Though there may be periods of remission, it usually lasts throughout life. Maturity, however, can bring reduced severity or even complete disap- pearance. Most patients have comorbid conditions, especially OCD and ADHD. Essential Features of Tourette\u2019s Disorder The first tics of patients with TD are often eye blinks that appear when the children are 6 or thereabouts. They are joined by vocal tics, which may initially be grunts or throat clearings. Eventually, patients with TD have multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic. The best-known tic of all, coprolalia\u2014swear words and other socially unacceptable speech\u2014is relatively uncommon.

That was when his mother noticed his first tic. At the breakfast table, she was looking at him across the top of a box of Post Toasties. As he read what was written on the back, every few seconds he would blink his eyes, squeezing them shut and then opening them wide. \u201cShe asked me what was wrong, said she wondered if I was having a convulsion,\u201d Gordon told the mental health clinician. He suddenly interrupted his story to yell, \u201cShit- fuck! Shit-fuck!\u201d As he bellowed out each exclamation, he twisted his head sharply to the right and shook it so that his teeth actually rattled. \u201cBut I never lost consciousness or anything like that. It was only the beginning of my Tourette\u2019s.\u201d Unperturbed by his sudden outburst, Gordon continued his story. Gradually throughout his childhood, he accumulated an assortment of facial twitches and other abrupt movements of his head and upper body. Each new motor tic earned renewed taunts from his classmates, but these were mild compared with the abuse he suffered once the vocal tics began. Not long after he turned 13, Gordon noticed that a certain tension would seem to accumulate in the back of his throat. He couldn\u2019t describe it\u2014it didn\u2019t tickle and it didn\u2019t have a taste. It wasn\u2019t something he could swallow down. Sometimes a cough would temporarily relieve it, but more often it seemed to require some form of vocal - ization to ease it. A bark or yelp usually worked just fine. But when it was most intense, only an obscenity would do. \u201cShit-fuck! Shit-fuck!\u201d he yelled again. Then \u201cCunt!\u201d Gordon shook his head again and hooted twice.

Then \u201cCunt!\u201d Gordon shook his head again and hooted twice. Halfway through his junior year in high school, the vocal tics got so bad that Gor- don was placed on \u201cpermanent suspension\u201d until he could learn to sit in a classroom without creating pandemonium. The third clinician his parents took him to prescribed haloperidol. This relieved his symptoms completely, except for the tendency to blink when he was under stress. He had remained on this drug until a month earlier, when he read an article about tardive dyskinesia and began to worry about his drug\u2019s side effects. Once he stopped taking the medication, the full spectrum of tics rapidly returned. He had recently been evaluated by his general physician, who had pronounced him healthy. He had never abused street drugs or alcohol. Gordon was a neatly dressed, pleasant- appearing young man who sat quietly for most of the interview. He really seemed quite ordinary, aside from exaggerated blink - Tourette\u2019s Disorder 41 ing, which occurred several times a minute. He sometimes accompanied the blinks by opening his mouth and curling his lips around his teeth. But every few minutes there occurred a small explosion of hoots, grunts, yelps, or barks, along with a variety of tics that involved his face, head, and shoulders. Irregularly, but with some frequency, his outbursts would include the expletives mentioned above\u2014 uttered with more volume than conviction. Afterwards, he would placidly resume the conversation. The remainder of Gordon\u2019s mental status was not remarkable. When he wasn\u2019t having tics, his speech was clear, coherent, relevant, and spontaneous, and he scored a perfect 30 on the Mini- Mental State Exam. He admitted that he was worried about his symptoms, but denied feeling depressed or especially anxious. He had never had hallucinations, delusions, or suicidal ideas. He also denied having obsessions and com- pulsions, adding, \u201cYou mean like Uncle George. He does rituals.\u201d Evaluation of Gordon Whitmore Gordon\u2019s symptoms had begun when he was a small child (criterion C) and included vocal as well as multiple motor tics (A), which had occurred frequently enough and long enough (B) to qualify him fully for a diagnosis of TD.

    "small child (criterion C) and included vocal as well as multiple motor tics (A), which had occurred frequently enough and long enough (B) to qualify him fully for a diagnosis of TD. He was otherwise healthy, so that another medical condition (especially a neurological disorder such as dystonia) would not appear to be a likely cause of his symptoms. Other mental disorders associated with abnormal movements include schizophrenia and amphetamine intoxication, but Gordon presented no evidence for either of these (D). The duration and full spectrum of vocal and multiple motor tics distinguished his condition from other tic disorders (persistent motor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder). We should also inquire about conditions that may be associated with TD. These include OCD and ADHD of childhood. (Gordon\u2019s uncle may have had OCD.) Gordon\u2019s diagnosis would therefore be as follows (I\u2019d assign him a GAF score of 55): F95.2 [307.23] Tourette\u2019s disorder F95.0 [307.21] Provisional Tic Disorder By definition, the tics in provisional tic disorder are transient. Usually, they are simple motor tics that begin at ages 3\u201310 and wax and wane over a period of weeks to months; vocal tics are less common than motor tics. A patient who has been diagnosed with persistent motor or vocal tic disorder can never receive the diagnosis of provisional tic disorder. F95.1 [307.22] Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder Once tics have been present for a year, they can no longer be considered provisional. Persistent motor tics also wax and wane over a range of severity. However, persistent 42 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS vocal tics are rare. Even persistent motor tics usually disappear within a few years, though they may recur in adults when individuals are tired or stressed. Although per - sistent tics are probably related genetically to TD, patients with TD cannot receive this diagnosis. F95.8 [307.20] Other Specified Tic Disorder F95.9 [307.20] Unspecified Tic Disorder Use unspecified tic disorder to code tics that don\u2019t fulfill criteria for one of the preced- ing tic disorders. Or you can specify the reason by using other specified tic disorder. One example would be tics that have apparently begun after age 18.

Motor Disorders F82 [315.4] Developmental Coordination Disorder Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is perhaps better known by a pejorative label\u2014\u201cclumsy-child syndrome.\u201d More or less synonymous with dyspraxia (meaning difficulty in performing skilled movements despite normal strength and sensation), DCD remains a focus of some controversy. And it\u2019s a big one, inasmuch as it affects perhaps 6% of children ages 5\u201310; a third of these have severe symptoms. By a ratio of about 4:1, boys are affected more often than girls. These young people have difficulty getting their bodies to perform as they might wish. Younger children experience delayed milestones, especially crawling, walking, speaking\u2014even getting dressed. Older children, usually chosen last for team sports because they don\u2019t catch, run, jump, or kick well, may have trouble making friends. Some children even have trouble mastering classroom skills such as coloring, printing, cursive, and cutting with scissors. Although the symptoms often stand on their own, for over half of patients DCD exists as part of a broader problem that includes attention deficits or learning problems such as dyslexia. Autism spectrum disorder has also been linked. After years of study, the cause is still unknown. In the individual case, a vari - ety of physical conditions must be ruled out: muscular dystrophy, congenital myasthe- nia, cerebral palsy, central nervous system tumors, epilepsy, Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, and Ehlers\u2013 Danlos disease. Obviously, late onset of motor incoordination after a normal start would weigh heavily against DCD. Motor skill deficits can persist through adolescence and into adult life, though little is known about the course of DCD in mature patients. Motor Disorders 43 Essential Features of Developmental Coordination Disorder Motor skills are so much poorer than you\u2019d expect, given a child\u2019s age, that they get in the way of progress in school, sports, or other activities. The specific motor behav- iors involved include general awkwardness; problems with balance; delayed develop- mental milestones; and slow achievement of basic skills such as jumping, throwing or catching a ball, and handwriting.

    "\u2022 Differen- tial diagnosis (physical conditions such as cerebral palsy; intellectual disability; autism spectrum disorder; ADHD) F98.4 [307.3] Stereotypic Movement Disorder Stereotypies are behaviors that people seem driven to perform over and again with - out any apparent goal\u2014 repetitive movement for the sake of motion. Such behavior is entirely normal in babies and young children, who will rock themselves, suck their thumbs, and put into their mouths just about anything that will fit. But when stereo - typies persist until later childhood and beyond, they may come to clinical attention as stereotypic movement disorder (SMD). The behaviors include rocking, hand flapping or waving, twiddling of fingers, pick- ing at skin, and spinning of objects. Serious injury can result from biting, head banging, or striking fingers, mouth parts, or other body parts. You\u2019ll typically encounter these behaviors in patients with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, though also in perhaps 3% of otherwise normal children with ADHD, tics, or OCD. Just what percentage of adults may be affected is actually unknown, though, other than in individuals with intellectual disability, it\u2019s probably uncommon. Of 20 adults with SMD in one study, 14 were women; a lifetime history of mood and anxiety disor - ders was the rule in these patients. Patients who abuse amphetamines may become fascinated with handling mechan- ical devices such as watches or radios, or picking at their own skin. Some will sort or rearrange small objects such as jewelry or even pebbles\u2014 punding (from a word popularized by amphetamine abusers), which may be related to excessive dopamine stimulation. SMD behaviors are associated with blindness (especially when it\u2019s congenital), deafness, Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome, temporal lobe epilepsy, and postencephalitic syn - drome, as well as severe instances of schizophrenia and OCD. It has also been reported in individual patients with Wilson\u2019s disease and brainstem stroke, several with the genetic syndrome cri du chat (\u201ccry of the cat,\u201d so called because of the characteristic sound the patients make as infants). You may also find SMD behavior in demented 44 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS elderly patients.

For some children, problems with communication are symptomatic of broader developmental problems, such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Many other children, however, have stand-alone disorders of speech and language. Disorders of speech include lack of speech fluidity (for example, stuttering); inac - curately produced or appropriately used speech sounds (as in speech sound disorder); and developmental verbal dyspraxias, which result from impaired motor control and coordination of speech organs. Disorders of language comprise problems with forma - tion of words (morphology) or sentences (syntax), language meaning (semantics), and the use of context (pragmatics). The old (DSM-IV) disorders of expressive and receptive language, as well as problems with reading and writing, have been subsumed within the latter category. These disorders still are not well understood or (often) well recognized. While they are differentiable, they are also highly comorbid with one another. F80.2 [315.32] Language Disorder",

These disorders still are not well understood or (often) well recognized. While they are differentiable, they are also highly comorbid with one another. F80.2 [315.32] Language Disorder Language disorder (LD) is a new category intended to cover language- related problems including spoken and written language (and even sign language) that are manifested in receptive and expressive language ability\u2014though these may be present to different degrees. Both vocabulary and grammar are usually affected. Patients with LD speak later and less than normal children, ultimately impairing academic progress. Later in life, occupational success may be impaired. The diagnosis should be based on history, direct observation, and standardized testing, though no actual testing results are specified in the criteria. The condition tends to persist, so that affected teens and adults will likely continue to have difficulty expressing themselves. This disorder has strong genetic underpinnings. Language impairments can also coexist with other developmental disorders, including intellectual disability, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder. Essential Features of Language Disorder Beginning early in childhood, a patient\u2019s use of spoken and written language per - sistently lags behind age expectations. Compared to age-mates, patients will have small vocabularies, impaired use of words to form sentences, and reduced ability to employ sentences to express ideas. 46 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration and demographics (begins in early childhood; tends to chronicity) \u2022 Disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (sensory impairment, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, learning disor- der\u2014though each of these may coexist with LD) F80.0 [315.39) Speech Sound Disorder Substituting one sound for another or omitting certain sounds completely is the sort of error made by patients with speech sound disorder (SSD), formerly called phonological disorder. The difficulty can arise from inadequate knowledge of speech sounds or from motor problems that interfere with speech production. Consonants are affected most often, as in lisping. Other examples include errors in the order of sounds (\u201cgaspetti\u201d for spaghetti). The errors of speech found in those who learn English as a second language are not considered examples of SSD. When SSD is mild, the effects may appear quaint or even cute, but the disorder renders more severely affected individuals hard to under- stand, sometimes unintelligible.

When SSD is mild, the effects may appear quaint or even cute, but the disorder renders more severely affected individuals hard to under- stand, sometimes unintelligible. Although SSD affects 2\u20133% of preschool children (it\u2019s more prevalent in boys), spontaneous improvement is the rule, reducing the prevalence to about 1 in 200 by late teens. The condition is familial and can occur with other language disorders, anxiety disorders (including selective mutism), and ADHD. Essential Features of Speech Sound Disorder The patient has problems producing the sounds of speech, compromising communi- cation.

The momentary panic that ensues Communication Disorders 47 may cause these people to take extreme measures to avoid difficult sounds or situ - ations\u2014even such ordinary experiences as using a telephone. Typically, they report anxiety or frustration, even physical tension. You\u2019ll notice children clenching their fists or blinking their eyes in the effort to regain control, especially when there is extra pres- sure to succeed (as when speaking to a group). Stuttering occurs especially with consonants; the initial sounds of words, the first word of a sentence; and words that are accented, long, or seldom used. It may be pro - voked by joke telling, saying one\u2019s own name, talking to strangers, or speaking to an authority figure. Stutterers often find that they are fluent when singing, swearing, or speaking to the rhythm of a metronome. On average, stuttering starts at age 5, but it can begin as young as 2. Because young children often have dysfluencies of speech, early stuttering is often ignored. Sudden onset may correlate with greater severity. As many as 3% of young children stutter; the percentage is higher for children with brain injuries or intellectual disability. Boys outnumber girls at least 3:1. Although reports vary, the prevalence in adults is about 1 in 1,000, of whom 80% are male. Stuttering",

Boys outnumber girls at least 3:1. Although reports vary, the prevalence in adults is about 1 in 1,000, of whom 80% are male. Stuttering runs in families, and there is some evidence of heritability. There are genetic (and some symptomatic) links to Tourette\u2019s disorder, which is a dopamine- related disorder; dopamine antagonists have been used to ameliorate the effects of stut- tering. Essential Features of Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering) These patients have problems speaking smoothly, most notably with sounds that are drawn out or repeated; there may be pauses in the middle of words. They experi - ence marked tension while speaking, and will repeat entire words or substitute easier words for those that are difficult to produce. The result: anxiety about the act of speaking.

The world of communications calls this pragmatics , and it involves several principal skills: \u2022\u2022 Using language to pursue different tasks, such as welcoming someone, commu- nicating facts, making a demand, issuing a promise, or making a request. \u2022\u2022 Adapting language in accord with the needs of a particular situation or indi - vidual, such as speaking differently to children than to adults or in class versus at home. \u2022\u2022 Adhering to the conventions of conversation, such as taking turns, staying on topic, using nonverbal (eye contact, facial expressions) as well as verbal signals, allowing adequate space between speaker and listener, or restating something that\u2019s been misinterpreted. \u2022\u2022 Understanding implied communications, such as metaphors, idioms, and humor.

Patients with SCD, whether children or adults, have difficulty understanding and using the pragmatic aspects of social communication, to the point that their conversations can be socially inappropriate. Yet they do not have the restricted interests and repetitive behaviors that would qualify them for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. SCD can occur by itself or with other diagnoses, such as other communication disorders, specific learning disorders, or intellectual disability. Essential Features of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder From early childhood, the patient has difficulty with each of these features: using language for social reasons, adapting communication to fit the context, following the conventions (rules) of conversation, and understanding implied communications.

Specific Learning Disorder Specific learning disorder (SLD) is a particular problem in acquiring information\u2014a problem that isn\u2019t consistent with a child\u2019s age and native intelligence, and that can\u2019t be explained by external factors such as culture or lack of educational opportunity. SLD thus comprises a set of discrepancies (in reading, mathematics, and written expression, as well as some not yet specified) between the child\u2019s theoretical ability to learn and actual academic achievement. Before a diagnosis can be affirmed, the criteria require evidence of significant deficit obtained from of an individually administered, standardized test that is psycho- metrically sound and culturally appropriate. Like the vast majority of DSM-5 disor - ders, SLD cannot be diagnosed unless it affects school, work, or social life. Of course, the child\u2019s intellectual level will affect the manifestation, prognosis, and remedy of the SLD. Except for the descriptive specifier \u201cwith impairment in written expression,\u201d which can appear a year or two later than the others, SLD usually declares itself by the time the child reaches second grade.

    "the others, SLD usually declares itself by the time the child reaches second grade. Two main groups of affected children have been identified. Most affected children have problems with language skills, includ - ing spelling and reading; these stem from a basic difficulty in processing sounds and symbols of language (in other words, they have a phonological processing disability). A smaller number have difficulties solving problems\u2014 visuospatial, motor, and/or tactile- perceptual problems that manifest as dyscalculia. In one form or another, SLD affects 5\u201310% of Americans over the course of their lifetimes; boys are two to four times more often affected than girls. Of course, a child\u2019s behavioral and social consequences are proportional to the severity of the impairment and to the available educational remediation and social support. Overall, however, as many as 40% of children formally diagnosed with SLD leave school before complet - ing high school, against a national average of about 6%. These disorders are likely to persist into adult life, where the prevalence is about half that for children. Of the types of SLD, problems with math are the most likely to have an influence on adult functioning. Children with SLD are also more likely to have behavioral or emotional problems, specifically ADHD (which worsens the mental health prognosis), autism spectrum dis- order, developmental coordination disorder, and communication disorders, as well as anxiety and mood disorders. 50 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS Specific Learning Disorder with Impairment in Reading (Dyslexia) The best- studied disorder of this group, the reading type of SLD (aka dyslexia), occurs when a child (or adult, should it persist) cannot read at the level expected for age and intelligence. It can take several forms: difficulty with comprehension or speed when the person is reading silently; with accuracy when the person is reading aloud; with spell- ing when the person is, well, trying to spell. Normally distributed throughout the popu- lation (and occurring at every intelligence level), dyslexia affects about 4% of school-age children, most of them boys. In the quest for causation, it is interesting to note that children are less likely to have reading problems when their native language has good correspondence between graphemes and phonemes (that is, the words sound generally the way they look). In that sense, English is relatively troublesome, Italian facile. Dyslexia has been attributed to a variety of environmental factors (lead poison - ing, fetal alcohol syndrome, low",
    "reading problems when their native language has good correspondence between graphemes and phonemes (that is, the words sound generally the way they look). In that sense, English is relatively troublesome, Italian facile. Dyslexia has been attributed to a variety of environmental factors (lead poison - ing, fetal alcohol syndrome, low socioeconomic status) and familial causes (inheritance may account for as many as 30% of cases). Especially at risk are socially disadvantaged children, who are less likely to receive the early stimulation that is important to child - hood development. Clinicians must rule out vision and hearing problems, behavioral disorders, and ADHD (which is often comorbid). Prognosis for dyslexia depends on several factors, especially its severity in the indi- vidual patient: Reading at two standard deviations below the population mean signifies an especially poor outlook. Other factors include parents\u2019 educational levels and the child\u2019s overall intellectual capabilities. Early identification of dyslexia improves outcome. One study showed that 40% of children treated when age 7 could read normally at age 14. However, some news isn\u2019t so good: Perhaps 40 million adult Americans are barely literate. Although reading accuracy tends to improve with time, fluency continues to be a problem into maturity. Adults may read slowly, confuse or mispronounce proper names and unfamiliar words, avoid reading aloud (due to embarrassment), or spell imaginatively (and choose words that are easier to spell). Frequently, reading is such a tiring chore that they choose not to read for pleasure. Specific Learning Disorder with Impairment in Mathematics (Dyscalculia) What do we know about the mathematics type of SLD? It\u2019s a little hard to figure. These people have difficulty performing mathematical operations\u2014 counting, understanding mathematical concepts and recognizing symbols, learning multiplication tables, per - forming operations as simple as addition or as complex as story problems\u2014but we don\u2019t really know the cause. Perhaps it\u2019s part of a larger nonverbal learning disability, or a problem in making a connection between number sense and the representation of numbers. Specific Learning Disorder 51 Whatever the cause, about 5% of schoolchildren are affected. Of course, you won\u2019t find it in very young children. Although it\u2019s been shown that even babies have number sense, this condition cannot rear its head until the age at which children are expected to start doing math\u2014 sometimes in kindergarten, but more usually by the beginning of second grade.

    "children. Although it\u2019s been shown that even babies have number sense, this condition cannot rear its head until the age at which children are expected to start doing math\u2014 sometimes in kindergarten, but more usually by the beginning of second grade. Gerstmann\u2019s syndrome is a collection of symptoms that results from a stroke or other dam- age to the left parietal lobe of the brain in the region of the angular gyrus. It comprises four main disabilities: problems with writing clearly ( agraphia or dysgraphia ), understanding the rules for calculation ( dyscalculia), telling left from right, and distinguishing fingers on the hand (finger agnosia). In addition, many adults have aphasia. The syndrome is sometimes reported in children, for whom the cause is unknown; some of these kids are otherwise quite bright. It is usually identified when a child starts school. besides the four main symptoms, many children also have dyslexia and cannot copy simple drawings\u2014a disability called constructional apraxia. Specific Learning Disorder with Impairment in Written Expression Patients with the written expression form of SLD have problems with grammar, punc- tuation, spelling, and developing their ideas in writing. Children have problems trans- lating information from oral/auditory form to visual/written form; what they write may be too simple, too brief, or too hard to follow. Some have trouble generating new ideas. Note that though handwriting may be indecipherable, you wouldn\u2019t make this diagnosis when poor penmanship is the only problem. This problem usually doesn\u2019t appear until second grade or later\u2014well after the usual onset of SLD in reading. Writing demands subsequently increase from third to sixth grade. It can be due to troubles with working memory (there\u2019s a problem with the organization of what the child is trying to say). The diagnosis is generally not appropri- ate if the patient is poorly coordinated, as in developmental coordination disorder. Essential Features of Specific Learning Disorder The patient has important problems with reading, writing, or arithmetic, to wit: Reading is slow or requires inordinate effort, or the patient has marked diffi - culty grasping the meaning. The patient has trouble with writing content (not the mechanics): There are 52 NEUrODEVELOPMENTAL DISO rDErS grammatical errors, ideas are expressed in an unclear manner or are poorly organized, or spelling is unusually \u201ccreative.\u201d The patient experiences unusual difficulty with math facts, calculation, or math- ematical reasoning.

(To facilitate discussion, I have not adhered to the order in which DSM-5 presents these conditions.) Schizophrenia and Schizophrenia-Like Disorders Schizophrenia. For at least 6 months, these patients have had two or more of these five types of psychotic symptom: delusions, disorganized speech, hallucinations, negative symp- toms, and catatonia or other markedly abnormal behavior. Ruled out as causes of the psy - chotic symptoms are significant mood disorders, substance use, and general medical condi- tions (p. 64). Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier). These patients have two or more of several behavioral characteristics (defined on p. 100). The specifier can be applied to disorders that include psychosis, mood disorders, autistic spectrum disorder, and other medical conditions (p. 100). Schizophreniform disorder. This category is for patients who have the basic symptoms of schizophrenia but have been ill for only 1\u20136 months\u2014less than the time specified for schizo- phrenia (p. 75). Schizoaffective disorder. For at least 1 month, these patients have had basic schizophrenia symptoms; at the same time, they have prominent symptoms of mania or depression (p. 88). Brief psychotic disorder. These patients will have had at least one of the basic psychotic symptoms for less than 1 month (p. 80). Other Psychotic Disorders Delusional disorder. These patients have delusions, but not the other symptoms of schizo - phrenia (p. 82). Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. A variety of medical and neurological conditions can produce psychotic symptoms that may not meet criteria for any of the condi- tions above (p. 97). Substance/medication- induced psychotic disorder. Alcohol or other substances (intoxica - tion or withdrawal) can cause psychotic symptoms that may not meet criteria for any of the conditions above (p. 93). Other specified, or unspecified, schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. Use one of these categories for patients with psychoses that don\u2019t seem to fit any of the catego- ries above (p. 106). Unspecified catatonia. Use when a patient has symptoms of catatonia but there isn\u2019t enough information to substantiate a more definitive diagnosis (p. 107).

Disorders with Psychosis as a Symptom Some patients have psychosis as a symptom of mental disorders discussed in other chapters. These disorders include the following: Mood disorder with psychosis. Patients with a severe major depressive episode (p. 112) or manic episode (p. 116) can have hallucinations and mood- congruent delusions. Cognitive disorders with psychosis. Many patients with delirium (p. 477) or major neurocog- nitive disorder (p. 492) have hallucinations or delusions. Personality disorders. Patients with borderline personality disorder may have transient peri- ods (minutes or hours) when they appear delusional (p. 545). Patients with schizophrenia may have premorbid schizoid or (especially) schizotypal personality disorder (pp. 535, 538). Disorders That Masquerade as Psychosis The symptoms of some disorders appear to be psychotic, but are not. These disorders include the following: Specific phobia. Some phobic avoidance behaviors can appear quite strange without being psychotic (p. 182). 56 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Intellectual disability. Patients with intellectual disability may at times speak or act bizarrely (p. 20). Somatic symptom disorder. Sometimes these patients will report pseudohallucinations or pseudodelusions (p. 251). Factitious disorder imposed on self. These patients may feign delusions or hallucinations in order to obtain hospital or other medical care (p. 268). Malingering. These persons may feign delusions or hallucinations in order to obtain money (insurance or disability payments), avoid work (such as in the military), or avoid punishment (p. 599). Whatever happened to folie \u00e0 deux (\u201cmadness of two\u201d)? For generations, this rarely encountered condition was a staple of mental health diagnostic schemes. It was termed shared psychotic disorder in recent DSMs, where it denoted patients who develop delu - sions similar to those held by a relative or other close associate. Often the second patient\u2019s delusions cleared up, once association with the first patient was severed. There are several reasons why this condition has been excluded from DSM-5. Through the decades, there has been precious little research that would help us understand shared psychotic disorder. We have case reports, some describing multiple secondary patients dependent on one primary source (folie \u00e0 trois, \u00e0 quatre, \u00e0 famille), but not much in the way of data. although most of these patients live with someone who has schizophrenia or delu - sional disorder, the phenomenon has also been linked to somatic symptom disorder,",

In other words, folie \u00e0 deux may be better conceptualized as a descriptive syndrome similar to the capgras phenome- non (in which patients believe that close associates have been replaced by exact doubles). Most patients who would formerly have been diagnosed as having folie \u00e0 deux (shared psychotic disorder) will fulfill criteria for delusional disorder, which is how they should now be categorized. Otherwise, you\u2019d have to diagnose them with other specified psychotic disorder and explain why. Introduction During the second half of the 20th century, one of the great leaps forward in mental health was to recognize that psychosis can have many causes. At least in part, this prog- ress can be credited to DSM-III and its forebears and successors, which have estab - lished and popularized criteria for many forms of psychosis. Introduction 57 The existence of psychosis is usually not hard to determine. Delusions, hallucina- tions, and disorganized speech or behavior are generally obvious; they often repre - sent a dramatic change from a person\u2019s normal behavior. But differentiating the various causes of psychosis can be difficult. Even experienced clinicians cannot definitively diagnose some patients, perhaps even after several interviews. Symptoms of Psychosis A psychotic patient is out of touch with reality. This state of mind can manifest in one or more of five basic types of symptom. These are DSM-5\u2019s criterion A inclusion require- ments for schizophrenia. Delusions A delusion is a false belief that cannot be explained by the patient\u2019s culture or educa - tion; the patient cannot be persuaded that the belief is incorrect, despite evidence to the contrary or the weight of opinion of other people. Delusions can be of many types, including these: Erotomanic. Someone (often of higher social station) is in love with a patient. Grandeur. A patient is a person of exalted station, such as God or a movie star. Guilt. A patient has committed an unpardonable sin or grave error. Jealousy. A spouse or partner has been unfaithful. Passivity. A patient is being controlled or manipulated by some outside influence, such as",
    "patient. Grandeur. A patient is a person of exalted station, such as God or a movie star. Guilt. A patient has committed an unpardonable sin or grave error. Jealousy. A spouse or partner has been unfaithful. Passivity. A patient is being controlled or manipulated by some outside influence, such as radio waves. Persecution. A patient is being hounded, followed, or otherwise interfered with. Poverty. Contrary to the evidence (a job and ample money in the bank), a patient faces destitution. Reference. A patient is being talked about, perhaps in the press or on TV. Somatic. Patients\u2019 body functions have altered, they smell bad, or they have a ter- rible disease. Thought control. Others are putting ideas into patients\u2019 minds. Delusions must be distinguished from overvalued ideas , which are beliefs that are not clearly false but continue to be held despite lack of proof that they are correct. Examples include belief in the superiority of one\u2019s own race or political party. 58 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Hallucinations A hallucination is a false sensory perception that occurs in the absence of a related sen- sory stimulus. Hallucinations are nearly always abnormal and can affect any of the five senses, though auditory and visual hallucinations are the most common. But they don\u2019t always mean that the person experiencing them is psychotic. To count as psychotic symptoms, hallucinations must occur when a person is awake and fully alert. This means that hallucinations occurring only during delirium can - not be taken as evidence of one of the psychotic disorders discussed in this chapter. The same can be said for hallucinatory experiences that occur when someone is falling asleep (hypnagogic) or awakening ( hypnopompic). These common experiences (which are not true hallucinations) are normal; they are better referred to as imagery. Another requirement for a psychotic symptom is that a person must lack insight into its unreality. You might think that this would apply to pretty much everyone, but you\u2019d be wrong. Consider, for example, the Charles Bonnet syndrome, in which people who have significant loss of vision see complex visual imagery\u2014but with full realization that the experience is unreal. Hallucinations must be discriminated from illusions, which are simply misinter - pretations of actual sensory stimuli. They usually occur during conditions of decreased sensory input, such as at night. (For example, a person awakens to the impression that a burglar is bending",
    "with full realization that the experience is unreal. Hallucinations must be discriminated from illusions, which are simply misinter - pretations of actual sensory stimuli. They usually occur during conditions of decreased sensory input, such as at night. (For example, a person awakens to the impression that a burglar is bending over the bed; when the light comes on, the \u201cburglar\u201d is only a pile of clothes on a chair.) Illusions are common and usually normal. Disorganized Speech Even without delusions or hallucinations, a psychotic patient may have disorganized speech (sometimes also called loose associations), in which mental associations are gov- erned not by logic but by rhymes, puns, and other rules not apparent to the observer, or by no evident rule at all. Some disorganization of speech is quite common (try reading an exact transcript of a politician\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks, for example). But by and large, when those words were spoken, listeners understood perfectly well what was intended. To be regarded as psychotically disorganized, the speech must be so badly impaired that it interferes with communication. Abnormal Behavior (Such as Catatonia) Disorganized behavior , or physical actions that do not appear to be goal- directed\u2014 disrobing in public (without theatrical or, perhaps, political intent), repeatedly mak - ing the sign of the cross, assuming and maintaining peculiar and often uncomfort - able postures\u2014may indicate psychosis. Again, note how hard it can be to identify a given behavior as disorganized. There are plenty of people who do strange things; lots of these folks aren\u2019t psychotic. Most patients whose behavior qualifies as psychotic Symptoms of Psychosis 59 will have actual catatonic symptoms, each of which has been carefully defined (see p. 101). Negative Symptoms Negative symptoms include reduced range of expression of emotion (flat or blunted affect), markedly reduced amount or fluency of speech, and loss of the will to do things (avolition). They are called negative because they give the impression that something has been taken away from the patient\u2014not added, as would be the case with halluci - nations and delusions. Negative symptoms reduce the apparent textural richness of a patient\u2019s personality. However, they can be hard to differentiate from dullness due to depression, drug use, or ordinary lack of interest. Distinguishing Schizophrenia from Other Disorders DSM-5 uses four classes of information to distinguish among the various types of psy - chosis: type of psychotic symptom, course of illness, consequences",
    "patient\u2019s personality. However, they can be hard to differentiate from dullness due to depression, drug use, or ordinary lack of interest. Distinguishing Schizophrenia from Other Disorders DSM-5 uses four classes of information to distinguish among the various types of psy - chosis: type of psychotic symptom, course of illness, consequences of illness, and exclu- sions. Each of these categories (plus a few other features) can help you distinguish schizophrenia, the most common psychotic disorder, from other disorders that include psychosis among their symptoms. The reason for this emphasis is that the differential diagnosis of psychosis very often boils down to schizophrenia versus nonschizophrenia. In terms of the numbers of patients affected and the seriousness of implications for treatment and prognosis, it is the single most important cause of psychotic symptoms. Psychotic Symptoms Any form of psychosis must include at least one of the five types of psychotic symptoms described above, but to be diagnosed as having schizophrenia, a patient must have two or more. Therefore, the first task in diagnosing any psychosis is to determine the extent of the psychotic symptoms. When two or more of these types of psychotic symptoms have been present for at least 1 month, and at least one of them is hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech, criterion A for schizophrenia is said to be satisfied. DSM-5 specifies that these two or more psychotic symptom types must be present for a \u201csignificant portion of time\u201d during that month. But what does significant mean in this context? It could be interpreted to mean that (1) these symptoms have been present on more than half the days in the month; (2) several persons independently may have observed on several days that the patient is having symptoms; or (3) the symptoms may have occurred at times when they are especially likely to affect the patient or the environment\u2014as with, for example, a patient who has repeatedly interrupted a social gathering by screaming. Finally, note that a duration of less than 1 month is allowed if treatment has caused the symptoms to remit. 60 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS For behavior to be psychotic, it must be grossly abnormal, and the patient must lack insight into its nature. Examples of psychotic behavior would include symptoms of catatonia, such as mutism, negativism, mannerisms, or stereotypies\u2014 without appar- ent recognition that the behaviors in question are abnormal. (For definitions of these",
    "For behavior to be psychotic, it must be grossly abnormal, and the patient must lack insight into its nature. Examples of psychotic behavior would include symptoms of catatonia, such as mutism, negativism, mannerisms, or stereotypies\u2014 without appar- ent recognition that the behaviors in question are abnormal. (For definitions of these symptoms, see the p. 101 sidebar.) An example of bizarre behavior that is not psychotic would be obsessive\u2013 compulsive rituals, which patients usually recognize as excessive or unreasonable. Delusions and hallucinations are the most commonplace symptoms of psychosis. As noted earlier, delusions must be discriminated from overvalued ideas, and hallucina- tions from illusions. Disorganized speech means speech that goes beyond the merely circumstantial\u2014 it must show marked loosening of associations. Examples: \u201cHe tells me something in one morning and out the other,\u201d \u201cHalf a loaf is better than the whole enchilada.\u201d Or, in response to the question, \u201cHow long did you live in Wichita?\u201d: \u201cEven anteaters like to Frenchkiss.\u201d Negative symptoms can be hard to pinpoint, unless you ask an informant about changes in affective lability, volition, or amount of speech. Negative symptoms can also be mistaken for the stiffening of affect sometimes caused by neuroleptic medications. For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, earlier DSM versions required only one type of psychotic symptom if it was either a bizarre delusion or hallucinated voices that talk to one another. We can feel pretty clear about the hallucinated voices, but what exactly does bizarre mean, anyway? Unhappily, the definition is neither exact nor constant across different studies. It isn\u2019t even consistent across different versions of the DSM, which refer to it with decreas - ing degrees of certitude: \u201cwith no possible basis in fact\u201d (DSM-III), \u201ctotally implausible\u201d (DSM-III-R), and \u201cclearly implausible\u201d (DSM-IV-TR). DSM-5 has nearly stepped away from the fray altogether, except as regards delusional disorder, where bizarre content is a speci- fier. There, bizarre is taken to mean not only \u201cclearly implausible,\u201d but also neither under- standable nor in accord with usual life experience. So we might as well adopt the original sense that came to us several hundred years ago from French: odd or fantastic . Examples of delusions we could call bizarre include falling down a rabbit hole to Wonderland, being controlled (in thoughts or actions) by aliens from Halley\u2019s comet, or having one\u2019s brain replaced by a computer chip.

    "French: odd or fantastic . Examples of delusions we could call bizarre include falling down a rabbit hole to Wonderland, being controlled (in thoughts or actions) by aliens from Halley\u2019s comet, or having one\u2019s brain replaced by a computer chip. Examples of non- bizarre delusions include being spied upon by neighbors or betrayed by one\u2019s spouse. (The assessment of what is and is not bizarre may vary with our distance from those we seek to judge: \u201cI am unique, you are odd, they are bizarre.\u201d) The recent weight of opinion is that the quality of bizarreness has little importance when it comes to diagnosis or prognosis. Therefore, in DSM-5, all patients with schizo - phrenia must have two or more types of psychotic symptoms, no matter how fantastic any one of them might be. Distinguishing Schizophrenia from Other Disorders 61 Course of Illness Cross- sectional symptoms are less important to the differential diagnosis of psychosis than is the course of illness. That is, the type of psychosis is largely determined by the longitudinal patterns and associated features of the disorder. Several of these factors are noted here: Duration. How long has the patient been ill? A duration of at least 6 months is required for a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. This rule was formulated decades ago, in response to the observation that psychotic patients who have been ill a long time tend at follow-up to have schizophrenia. Patients with a briefer duration of psychosis may turn out to have some other disorder. For years, we\u2019ve operationally defined the time required as 6 months or longer. Precipitating factors. Severe emotional stress sometimes precipitates a brief period of psychosis. For example, the stress of childbirth precipitates what we call a postpartum psychosis. A chronic course is less likely if there are precipitating factors, including this one. Previous course of illness. A prior history of complete recovery (no residual symp- toms) from a psychosis suggests a disorder other than schizophrenia. Premorbid personality. Good social and job- related functioning before the onset of psychotic symptoms directs our diagnostic focus away from schizophrenia and toward another psychotic disorder, such as a psychotic depression or a psychosis due to another medical condition or substance use. Residual symptoms. Once the acute psychotic symptoms have been treated (usu- ally with medication), residual symptoms may persist.

    "another psychotic disorder, such as a psychotic depression or a psychosis due to another medical condition or substance use. Residual symptoms. Once the acute psychotic symptoms have been treated (usu- ally with medication), residual symptoms may persist. These are often milder man- ifestations of the person\u2019s earlier delusions or other active psychotic symptoms: odd beliefs, vague speech that wanders off the point, a reduced lack of interest in the company of others. They augur for the subsequent return of psychosis. Consequences of Illness Psychosis can seriously affect the functioning of both patient and family. The degree of this effect can help discriminate schizophrenia from other causes of psychosis. To be diagnosed as having schizophrenia, the patient must have materially impaired social or occupational functioning. For example, most patients with schizophrenia never marry and either don\u2019t work at all or hold jobs that require a lower level of functioning than is consistent with their education and training. The other psychotic disorders do not require this criterion for diagnosis. In fact, the criteria for delusional disorder even specify that functioning is not impaired in any important way except as it relates spe - cifically to the delusions. 62 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Exclusions Once the fact of psychosis is established, can it be attributed to any mental disorder other than schizophrenia? We must consider at least three sets of possibilities. First, the top place in any differential diagnosis belongs to disorders caused by physical conditions. History, physical examination, and laboratory testing must be scru- tinized for evidence. See the table \u201cPhysical Disorders That Affect Mental Diagnosis\u201d in the Appendix for a listing of some of these disorders. Next, rule out substance- related disorders. Has the patient a history of abusing alcohol or street drugs? Some of these (cocaine, alcohol, psychostimulants, and the psy- chotomimetics) can cause psychotic symptoms that closely mimic schizophrenia. The use of prescription medications (such as adrenocorticosteroids) can also produce symp- toms of psychosis. See the table \u201cClasses (or Names) of Medications That Can Cause Mental Disorders\u201d in the Appendix for more information. Finally, consider mood disorders. Are there prominent symptoms of either mania or depression? The history of mental health treatment is awash in patients whose mood disorders have for years been diagnosed as schizophrenia. Mood disorders should be included early in the differential diagnosis of any patient with psychosis. Other Features You should also think",
    "Are there prominent symptoms of either mania or depression? The history of mental health treatment is awash in patients whose mood disorders have for years been diagnosed as schizophrenia. Mood disorders should be included early in the differential diagnosis of any patient with psychosis. Other Features You should also think about some features of psychosis that are not included in the DSM-5 criteria sets. Some of these can help predict outcome. They include the follow- ing: Family history of illness. A close relative with schizophrenia increases your patient\u2019s chances of also having schizophrenia. Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features also runs in families. Always learn as much as you can about the family history, so you can form your own judgment; accepting another clinician\u2019s opinion about diagnosis can be risky. Response to medication. Regardless of how psychotic the patient appears, previ - ous recovery with, say, lithium treatment suggests a diagnosis of mood disorder. Age at onset. Schizophrenia usually begins by a person\u2019s mid-20s. Onset of illness after the age of 40 suggests some other diagnosis. It could be delusional disorder, but you should consider a mood disorder. However, late onset does not completely rule out a schizophrenia diagnosis, especially of the type we used to call paranoid. I have intentionally written up the material that follows in a different order from that adopted by DSM-5. The stated intention of that manual is to order its material along \u201ca gradient of psychopathology\u201d that clinicians should generally follow, so that they consider Distinguishing Schizophrenia from Other Disorders 63 first conditions that don\u2019t attain full status as psychotic disorders or that affect relatively fewer aspects of a patient\u2019s life. Hence DSM-5 begins with schizotypal personality disorder and progresses next to delusional disorder and catatonia. Here\u2019s the reasoning for my approach. a s a general matter, I agree that we should evaluate our patients along a safety continuum, beginning with disorders that can be more readily treated (such as a substance- induced psychotic disorder) or those that have a rela- tively better prognosis (such as mood disorders with psychosis). However, from an educa- tional point of view, it helps me to describe first a condition (schizophrenia) that includes all conceivable symptoms and then fiddle with variations.

    "tional point of view, it helps me to describe first a condition (schizophrenia) that includes all conceivable symptoms and then fiddle with variations. I believe that my approach is more likely to help you learn the basic features of psychosis. The Schizophrenia Spectrum F20.9 [295.90] Schizophrenia In an effort to achieve precision, the DSM criteria for schizophrenia have become more complicated over the years. But the basic pattern of diagnosis remains so straightfor - ward that it can be outlined briefly. 1. Before becoming ill, the patient may have a withdrawn or otherwise peculiar personality. 2. For some time (perhaps 3\u20136 years) before becoming clinically ill, the patient may have experiences that, while not actually psychotic, portend the later onset of psychosis. This prodromal period is characterized by abnormalities of thought, language, perception, and motor behavior. 3. The illness proper begins gradually, often imperceptibly. At least 6 months before a diagnosis is made, behavior begins to change. Right from the start, this may involve delusions or hallucinations; or it may be heralded by milder symptoms, such as beliefs that are peculiar but not psychotic. 4. The patient has been frankly psychotic during at least 1 month of those 6. There have been two or more of the five basic symptom types described at the start of this chapter; hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech must be one of the two. 5. The illness causes important problems with work and social functioning. 6. The clinician can exclude other medical disorders, substance use, and mood disorders as probable causes. 7. Although most patients improve with treatment, relatively few recover to such an extent that they return completely to their premorbid state. 64 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS There are several reasons why it is important to diagnose schizophrenia accurately: Frequency. It is a common condition: Up to 1% of the general adult population will contract this disorder. For unknown reasons, males become symptomatic several years younger than do females. Chronicity. Most patients who develop schizophrenia continue to have symptoms throughout their lives. Severity. Although most patients do not require months or years of hospitaliza - tion, as was the case before neuroleptic medications were developed, incapacity for social and work functioning can be profound. Psychotic symptoms can vary in their degree of severity (see sidebar, p. 74). Management. Adequate treatment almost always means using antipsychotic drugs, which, despite their risk of side",
    "of hospitaliza - tion, as was the case before neuroleptic medications were developed, incapacity for social and work functioning can be profound. Psychotic symptoms can vary in their degree of severity (see sidebar, p. 74). Management. Adequate treatment almost always means using antipsychotic drugs, which, despite their risk of side effects, often must be taken lifelong. Although nearly everyone does so, it is probably incorrect to speak of schizophre- nia as if it were one disease. It is almost certainly a collection of several underlying etiologies, for which the same basic diagnostic criteria are used. It is also important to note that many symptoms in addition to the formal criteria are often found in patients with schizophrenia. Here are a few: Cognitive dysfunction. Distractibility, disorientation, or other cognitive problems are often noted, though the symptoms of schizophrenia are classically described as occurring in a clear sensorium. Dysphoria. Anger, anxiety, and depression are some of the common emotional reactions to ensuing psychosis. Other patients show inappropriate affect (such as giggling when nothing appears to be funny). Anxiety attacks and disorders are increasingly identified. Absence of insight. Many patients refuse to take medicine in the mistaken belief that they are not ill. Sleep disturbance. Some patients stay up late and arise late when they are attempt- ing to deal with the onset of hallucinations or delusions. Substance use. Especially common is tobacco use, which affects 80% of all patients with schizophrenia. Suicide. Up to 10% of these patients (especially newly diagnosed young men) take their own lives. Because schizophrenia can present in so many different ways, and because it is so important (to individuals, society, and the history of mental disorder), I will illustrate with the stories of four patients. Schizophrenia 65 Essential Features of Schizophrenia The classic picture of a patient with schizophrenia is of a young person (late teens or 20s) who has had (1) delusions (especially persecutory) and (2) hallucinations (especially auditory). However, some patients will have (3) speech that is incoherent or otherwise disorganized, (4) severely abnormal psychomotor behavior (catatonic symptoms), or (5) negative symptoms such as restricted affect or lack of volition (they don\u2019t feel motivated to do work, maintain family life). Diagnosis requires at least two of these five types of psychotic symptoms, at least one of which must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech (criterion A). The patient is likely to have some mood symptoms,",
    "affect or lack of volition (they don\u2019t feel motivated to do work, maintain family life). Diagnosis requires at least two of these five types of psychotic symptoms, at least one of which must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech (criterion A). The patient is likely to have some mood symptoms, but they will be relatively brief. Illness usually begins gradually, perhaps almost imperceptibly, and builds across at least 6 months in a crescendo of misery and chaos. The Fine Print Don\u2019t dismiss the D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (6+ months, with criterion A symptoms for at least a month) \u2022 Distress or disability (social, occupational, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differ- ential diagnosis (other psychotic disorders, mood or cognitive disorders, physical and substance- induced psychotic disorders, peculiar ideas\u2014often political or religious\u2014 shared by a community) Coding Notes Specify: With catatonia (see p. 100) If the disorder has lasted at least 1 year, specify course: First episode, currently in acute episode First episode, currently in partial remission First episode, currently in full remission Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission Multiple episodes, currently in full remission Continuous Unspecified You may specify severity, though you don\u2019t have to (see p. 74). 66 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Whereas DSM-IV (and each of its predecessors) listed several subtypes of schizophrenia, DSM-5 has largely done away with them. Why is this? and why were they there in the first place? Sadly, the venerable categories of hebephrenic (disorganized), catatonic, and para - noid types, each of which has roots deep in the 19th century, simply didn\u2019t predict much\u2014 not enough, at any rate, to justify their existence. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t necessarily hold true to type from one episode of psychosis to the next. c atatonia, always encountered more often in illnesses other than schizophrenia, has now been demoted to a specifier denoting behaviors that apply not just to schizophrenia but to mood disorders as well as to physical illnesses. and the other old categories, while interesting to discuss (at least by clinicians old enough to have been weaned on these concepts), have been relegated to history\u2019s dust bin, along with fever therapy and wet sheet packs.

During the first few grades in school, he seemed almost suspicious if other children talked to him. He seldom seemed to feel at ease, even with those he had known since kindergarten. He never smiled or showed much emotion, so that by the time he was 10, even his siblings thought he was peculiar. Adults said he was \u201cnervous.\u201d For a few months during his early teens, he was interested in magic and the occult; he read extensively about witchcraft and casting spells. Later he decided he would like to become a minister. He spent long hours in his room learning Bible pas - sages by heart. Lyonel had never been much interested in sex, but at age 24, still attending col - lege, he was attracted to a girl in his poetry class. Mary had blonde hair and dark blue eyes, and he noticed that his heart skipped a beat when he first saw her. She always said \u201cHello\u201d and smiled when they met. He didn\u2019t want to betray too great an interest, so he waited until an evening several weeks later to ask her to a New Year\u2019s Eve party. She refused him, politely but firmly. As Lyonel mentioned to an interviewer months later, he thought that this seemed strange. During the day Mary was friendly and open with him, but when he ran into her at night, she was reserved. He knew there was a message in this that eluded him, and it made him feel shy and indecisive. He also noticed that his thoughts had speeded up so that he couldn\u2019t sort them out. \u201cI noticed that my mental energy had lessened,\u201d he told the interviewer, \u201cso I went to see the doctor. I told him I had gas forming on my intestines, and I thought it was giving me erections. And my muscles seemed all flabby. He asked me if I used drugs or was feeling depressed. I told him neither one. He gave me a prescription for some tranquilizers, but I just threw it away.\u201d Lyonel\u2019s skin was pasty white and he was abnormally thin, even for someone so Schizophrenia 67 slightly built.

    "I used drugs or was feeling depressed. I told him neither one. He gave me a prescription for some tranquilizers, but I just threw it away.\u201d Lyonel\u2019s skin was pasty white and he was abnormally thin, even for someone so Schizophrenia 67 slightly built. Casually dressed, he sat quietly without fidgeting during that interview. His speech was entirely ordinary; one thought flowed logically into the next, and there were no made-up words. By summer, he had become convinced that Mary was thinking about him. He decided that something must be keeping them apart. Whenever he had this feeling, his thoughts seemed to become so loud that he felt sure other people must be able to hear. He neglected to look for a summer job that year and moved back into his parents\u2019 house, where he kept to his room, brooding. He wrote long letters to Mary, most of which he destroyed. In the fall, Lyonel realized that his relatives were trying to help him. Although they would wink an eye or tap a finger to let him know when she was near, it did no good. She continued to elude him, sometimes only by minutes. At times there was a ringing in his right ear, which caused him to wonder whether he was becoming deaf. His suspicion seemed confirmed by what he privately called \u201ca clear sign.\u201d One day while driving he noticed, as if for the first time, the control button for his rear window defroster. It was labeled \u201crear def,\u201d which to him meant \u201cright-ear deafness.\u201d When winter deepened and the holidays approached, Lyonel knew that he would have to take action. He drove off to Mary\u2019s house to have it out with her. As he crossed town, people he passed nodded and winked at him to signal that they understood and approved. A woman\u2019s voice, speaking clearly from just behind him in the back seat, said, \u201cTurn right!\u201d and \u201cAtta boy!\u201d Evaluation of Lyonel Childs Two of the five symptoms listed in DSM-5\u2019s criterion A must be present for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Lyonel did have two\u2014 delusions (criterion A1) and hallucinations (A2). Note this new feature in DSM-5: A diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that at least one of delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech be among the patient\u2019s psychotic symptoms.

    "two\u2014 delusions (criterion A1) and hallucinations (A2). Note this new feature in DSM-5: A diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that at least one of delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech be among the patient\u2019s psychotic symptoms. As with Lyonel, the hallucinations of schizophrenia are usually auditory. Visual hallucinations often indicate a substance- induced psychotic disorder or psychotic dis- order due to another medical condition; they can also occur in major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and delirium. Hallucinations of sense or smell are more com - monly experienced by a person whose psychosis is due to another medical condition, but their presence would not rule out schizophrenia. As with Lyonel, auditory hallucinations are typically clear and loud; patients will often agree with the examiner who asks, \u201cIs it as loud as my voice is right now?\u201d Although the voices may seem to come from within a patient\u2019s head, the source may be located elsewhere\u2014the hallway, a household appliance, the family\u2019s cat. The special messages that Lyonel received (finger tapping, eye winking) are called delusions of reference. Patients with schizophrenia may also experience other sorts of delusions; I\u2019ve listed these on page 58. Often delusions are to some extent persecutory 68 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS (that is, the patient feels in some way pursued or interfered with). None of Lyonel\u2019s delusional ideas were so far from normal human experience that I\u2019d call them bizarre. Lyonel did not have disorganized speech, catatonic behavior, or negative symp - toms, but others with schizophrenia may. His illness significantly interfered with his work (he didn\u2019t get a summer job) and his relationships with others (he stayed in his room and brooded). We can infer that in each of these areas he functioned much less well than before he became ill (B). Although Lyonel had heard voices for only a short time, he had been delusional for several months. The prodromal symptoms (his concerns about intestinal gas and feel - ing of reduced mental energy) had begun a year or more earlier. As a result, he easily fulfilled the requirement of a total duration (prodrome, active symptoms, and residual period) of at least 6 months (C). The doctor Lyonel consulted found no evidence of another medical condition (E). Auditory hallucinations that may exactly mimic those encountered in schizophrenia can occur in alcohol- induced psychotic disorder.

    "residual period) of at least 6 months (C). The doctor Lyonel consulted found no evidence of another medical condition (E). Auditory hallucinations that may exactly mimic those encountered in schizophrenia can occur in alcohol- induced psychotic disorder. People who are withdrawing from amphetamines may even harm themselves as they attempt to escape terrifying per - secutory delusions. We might suspect either of these disorders if Lyonel had recently used substances. Lyonel also denied feeling depressed. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features can produce delusions or hallucinations, but often these are mood- congruent (they center around feelings of guilt or deserved punishment). Schizoaffective disorder could be excluded because he had no prominent mood symptoms (depressive or manic, D). From the duration of his symptoms, we know not to diagnose schizophreniform disorder. Many patients with schizophrenia also have an abnormal premorbid personality. Often this takes the form of schizoid or, especially, schizotypal personality disorder. As a child, Lyonel had at least five features of schizotypal personality disorder (see p. 538). These included constricted affect, no close friends, odd beliefs (interest in the occult), peculiar appearance (as judged by peers), and suspiciousness of other children. However, he had no history that would cause us to consider autism spectrum disorder (F). With two psychotic symptoms and a duration of more than 6 months, Lyonel\u2019s illness easily matches the prototype for typical schizophrenia. Note that (as with most DSM-5 disorders) medical and substance use causes must be ruled out, and other, more treatable mental etiologies must be deemed less likely. Throughout his current episode, Lyonel had had no change of symptoms that might suggest anything other than a continuous course. He had been ill for just about 1 year. I\u2019d peg his current GAF score at 30, and his overall diagnosis would be as follows: F20.9 [295.90] Schizophrenia, first episode, currently in acute episode F21 [301.22] Schizotypal personality disorder (premorbid) Z56.9 [V62.29] Unemployed Schizophrenia 69 In evaluating patients who have delusions or hallucinations, be sure to consider the cogni- tive disorders. This is especially true in an older patient whose psychosis has developed quite rapidly. and patients with schizophrenia who have active hallucinations or delusions should be asked about symptoms of dysphoria. They are likely to have depression or anxi- ety (or both) that could require additional treatment. Bob Naples As his sister told it, Bob Naples was always quiet when he was a kid,",
    "and patients with schizophrenia who have active hallucinations or delusions should be asked about symptoms of dysphoria. They are likely to have depression or anxi- ety (or both) that could require additional treatment. Bob Naples As his sister told it, Bob Naples was always quiet when he was a kid, but not what you\u2019d call peculiar or strange. Nothing like this had ever happened in their family before. Bob sat in a tiny consulting room down the hall. His lips moved soundlessly, and one bare leg dangled across the arm of his chair. His sole article of clothing was a red- and-white- striped pajama top. An attendant tried to drape a green sheet across his lap, but he giggled and flung it to the floor. It was hard for his sister, Sharon, to say when Bob first began to change. He was never very sociable, she said; \u201cYou might even call him a loner.\u201d He hardly ever laughed and always seemed rather distant, almost cold; he never appeared to enjoy anything he did very much. In the 5 years since he\u2019d finished high school, he had lived at their house while he worked in her husband\u2019s machine shop, but he never really lived with them. He had never had a girlfriend\u2014or a boyfriend, for that matter, though he some- times used to talk with a couple of high school classmates if they dropped around. About a year and a half ago, Bob had completely stopped going out and wouldn\u2019t even return phone calls. When Sharon asked him why, he said he had better things to do. But all he did when he wasn\u2019t working was stay in his room. Sharon\u2019s husband had told her that at work, Bob stayed at his lathe during breaks and talked even less than before. \u201cSometimes Dave would hear Bob giggling to himself. When he\u2019d ask what was funny, Bob would kind of shrug and just turn away, back to his work.\u201d For over a year, things didn\u2019t change much. Then, about 2 months earlier, Bob had started staying up at night. The family would hear him thumping around in his room, banging drawers, occasionally throwing things. Sometimes it sounded like he was talk- ing to someone, but his bedroom was on the second floor and he had no phone. He stopped going in to work. \u201cOf course, Dave\u2019d never fire him,\u201d Sharon contin -",

Sometimes he\u2019d just leave it spinning and wander over to stare out the window. Dave was relieved when he stopped coming in.\u201d In the last several weeks, all Bob would say was \u201cGilgamesh.\u201d Once Sharon asked him what it meant and he answered, \u201cIt\u2019s no red shoe on the backspace.\u201d This aston - ished her so much that she wrote it down. After that, she gave up trying to ask him for explanations. Sharon could only speculate how Bob came to be in the hospital. When she\u2019d come 70 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS home from the grocery store a few hours earlier, he was gone. Then the phone rang and it was the police, saying that they were taking him in. A security guard down at the mall had taken him into custody. He was babbling something about Gilgamesh and wear - ing nothing but a pajama top. Sharon blotted the corner of her eye with the cuff of her sleeve. \u201cThey aren\u2019t even his pajamas\u2014they belong to my daughter.\u201d Evaluation of Bob Naples Do take a few moments to review Bob\u2019s history for the elements of the typical schizo - phrenia prototype. This is the picture to carry around in your head, against which you\u2019ll match future patients. With several psychotic symptoms, Bob fully met the basic criteria for schizophre- nia. Besides his badly disorganized speech (criterion A3) and behavior (going out nude, A4), he had the negative symptoms of not speaking and lack of volition (he stopped going to work\u2014A5). Although he had had active symptoms for perhaps only a few months, his decreased (even for him) sociability had begun well over a year before, extending the total duration of his illness (C) well beyond the 6-month threshold. The vignette makes clear the devastating effect of symptoms on his work and social life (B). However, even with these typical features, there are still several exclusions to be ruled out.

    "duration of his illness (C) well beyond the 6-month threshold. The vignette makes clear the devastating effect of symptoms on his work and social life (B). However, even with these typical features, there are still several exclusions to be ruled out. Bob would say only one word when he was admitted, so it could not be determined whether he had a cognitive deficit, as would be the case in a delirium or in an amphet- amine- or phencyclidine- induced psychotic disorder. Only after treatment was begun might his cognitive status be known for sure. Other evidence of gross brain disease (E) could be sought with skull X-rays, MRI, and blood tests as appropriate. Patients with bipolar I disorder can show gross defect of judgment by refusing to remain clothed, but Bob did not have any of the other typical features of mania, such as euphoric mood or hyperactivity\u2014 certainly not pressured speech. The absence of prominent mood symptoms would rule out major depressive episode and schizoaf - fective disorder (D). Over a year earlier, Bob had been found giggling to himself at his lathe, so the early manifestations of his illness had been present for far longer than the 6-month minimum for schizophrenia; we can therefore dismiss schizophreniform disorder. Several of Bob\u2019s symptoms are typical for what used to be called disorganized schizophrenia. His affect was inappropriate (he laughed without apparent cause), although reduced lability (termed flat or blunted ) would also qualify as a negative symptom. By the time of his evaluation, his speech had been reduced to a single word, but earlier it had been incoherent (and peculiar enough that his sister even wrote some of it down). Finally, there was loss of volition (the will to do things): He had stopped going to work and spent most of his time in his room, apparently accomplishing noth - ing. From Sharon\u2019s information, a premorbid diagnosis of some form of personality dis- order would also seem warranted. Bob\u2019s specific symptoms included the following: no close friends, not desiring relationships, choosing solitary activities, lack of pleasure Schizophrenia 71 in activities, and no sexual experiences. This is a pattern, often noted in patients with schizophrenia, called schizoid personality disorder (p. 535). Although Bob\u2019s eventual diagnosis would seem evident, we should await the results of lab testing to rule out causes of psychosis other than schizophrenia. Therefore, we\u2019ll add the qualifier (provisional)",

F20.9 [295.90] Schizophrenia, first episode, currently in acute episode (provisional) F60.1 [301.20] Schizoid personality disorder (premorbid) Disorganized schizophrenia was first recognized nearly 150 years ago. It was originally termed hebephrenia because it began early in life ( hebe is Greek for youth ). Patients with disorganized schizophrenia can appear the most obviously psychotic of all. They often deteriorate rapidly, talk gibberish, and neglect hygiene and appearance. More recent research, however, has determined that the pattern of symptoms doesn\u2019t predict enough to make disorganized schizophrenia a useful diagnostic subcategory\u2014other than as a description of current symptoms. Natasha Oblamov \u201cShe\u2019s nowhere near as bad as Ivan.\u201d Mr. Oblamov was talking about his two grown children. At 30 years of age, Ivan had such severe disorganized schizophrenia (as it was then known) that, despite neuroleptics and a trial of electroconvulsive therapy, he could not put 10 words together so they made sense. Now Natasha, 3 years younger than her brother, had been brought to the clinic with similar complaints. Natasha was an artist. She specialized in oil-on- canvas copies of the photographs she took of the countryside near her home. Although she had had a one-woman exhibi- tion in a local art gallery 2 years earlier, she had never yet earned a dollar from her art- work. She had a room in her father\u2019s apartment, where the two lived on his retirement income. Her brother lived on a back ward of the state mental hospital. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s been going on for quite a while now,\u201d said Mr. Oblamov. \u201cI should have done something earlier, but I didn\u2019t want to believe it was happening to her, too.\u201d The signs had first appeared about 10 months ago, when Natasha stopped attend - ing class at the art institute and gave up her two or three drawing pupils. Mostly she stayed in her room, even at mealtimes; she spent much of her time sketching. Her father finally brought Natasha for evaluation because she kept opening the door.

    "ing class at the art institute and gave up her two or three drawing pupils. Mostly she stayed in her room, even at mealtimes; she spent much of her time sketching. Her father finally brought Natasha for evaluation because she kept opening the door. Perhaps 6 weeks earlier she had begun emerging from her room several times each evening, standing uncertainly in the hallway for several moments, then opening the front door. After peering up and down the hallway, she would retreat to her own room. In the past week, she had reenacted this ritual a dozen times each evening. Once 72 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS or twice, her father thought he heard her mutter something about \u201cJason.\u201d When he asked her who Jason was, she only looked blank and turned away. Natasha was a slender woman with a round face and watery blue eyes that never seemed to focus. Although she volunteered almost nothing, she answered every ques - tion clearly and logically, if briefly. She was fully oriented and had no suicidal ideas or other problems with impulse control. Her affect was as flat as one of her canvases. She would describe her most frightening experiences with no more emotion than she would making a bed. Jason was an instructor at the art institute. Some months earlier, one afternoon when her father was out, he had come to the apartment to help her with \u201csome special stroking techniques,\u201d as she put it (referring to her brush). Although they had ended up naked together on the kitchen floor, she had spent most of that time explaining why she felt she should put her clothes back on. He left unrequited, and she never returned to the art institute. Not long afterward, Natasha \u201crealized\u201d that Jason was hanging about, trying to see her again. She would sense his presence just outside her door, but each time she opened it, he had vanished. This puzzled her, but she couldn\u2019t say that she felt depressed, angry, or anxious. Within a few weeks she started to hear a voice quite a bit like Jason\u2019s, which seemed to be speaking to her from the photographic enlarger she had set up in the tiny second bathroom. \u201cIt usually just said the \u2018C word,\u2019 \u201d she explained in response to a question. \u201cThe \u2018C word\u2019?\u201d \u201cYou know, the place on a woman\u2019s body where you",

Several times in the past several weeks, Jason had slipped through her window at night and climbed into her bed while she slept. She had awakened to feel the pressure of his body on hers; it was especially intense in her groin area. By the time she had fully awakened, he would be gone. The previous week when she went in to use the bath - room, the head of an eel\u2014or perhaps it was a large snake\u2014 emerged from the toilet bowl and lunged at her. She lowered the lid on the animal\u2019s neck and it disappeared. Since then, she had only used the toilet in the hall bathroom. Evaluation of Natasha Oblamov Natasha had a variety of psychotic symptoms. They included visual hallucinations (the eel in the toilet\u2014 criterion A2) and a nonbizarre delusion about Jason (A1). She also had the negative symptom of flat affect (she talked about eels and her private anatomy with- out a hint of emotion\u2014A5). Although her active symptoms had been evident for only a few months, the prodromal symptom of staying in her room had been present for about 10 months (C). I can\u2019t identify anything in the vignette I\u2019d call lack of volition, but her disorder obviously interfered with her ability to complete a canvas (B). Nothing in Natasha\u2019s history would suggest another medical condition (E) that could explain her symptoms. However, a certain amount of routine lab testing might Schizophrenia 73 be ordered initially: complete blood count, routine blood chemistries, urinalysis. No evidence is given in the vignette to suggest that she had a substance- induced psy- chotic disorder, and her affect, though flat, was pleasant enough\u2014 nothing like the severely depressed mood of a major depressive disorder with psychotic features (D). Furthermore, she had never had suicidal ideas, and nothing suggested a manic epi - sode. Duration of illness longer than 6 months rules out schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder.

    "of a major depressive disorder with psychotic features (D). Furthermore, she had never had suicidal ideas, and nothing suggested a manic epi - sode. Duration of illness longer than 6 months rules out schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder. Finally, her brother had schizophrenia. About 10% of the first- degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of patients with schizophrenia also develop this condition. Of course, this is not a criterion for diagnosis, but it does help point the way. Natasha fulfilled all elements of the prototype: psychotic symptoms, duration, and absence of other causes (especially medical and substance use disorders). Although age of onset isn\u2019t included in the DSM-5 criteria, I\u2019ve mentioned it in the prototype. Anyone who becomes psychotic after, say, age 35 needs an evaluation even more careful than usual\u2014for other, possibly treatable causes. In an earlier time (DSM-IV), Natasha\u2019s symptoms would have earned her a diagnostic subtype of undifferentiated ; now everyone\u2019s diagnosis is undifferentiated. Because she\u2019d been ill less than a year (though well over the 6-month minimum), there would be no course specifier. I\u2019d assign her a GAF score of 30. Her diagnosis would be simply this: F20.9 [295.90] Schizophrenia, first episode, acute DSM-5 encourages us to rate each patient\u2019s psychotic symptoms on a 5-point scale. Each of the five criterion a symptoms is rated as 0 = absent, 1 = equivocal (not strong or long enough to be considered psychotic), 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, or 4 = severe. In addition, the manual notes that a similar rating scheme should be used for impaired cognition, depres- sion, and mania, because each of these features is important in the differential diagnosis of psychotic patients. These ratings can be attached to several of the different psychotic disorders discussed in this chapter. but the use of this rating system for severity is (happily, in my judgment) optional. Ramona Kelt When she was 20 and had been married only a few months, Ramona Kelt was hospital- ized for the first time with what was then described as \u201chebephrenic schizophrenia.\u201d According to records, her mood had been silly and inappropriate, her speech disjointed and hard to follow. She had been taken for evaluation after putting coffee grounds and orange peels on her head. She told the staff about television cameras in her closet that spied upon her whenever she had sex.

    "and inappropriate, her speech disjointed and hard to follow. She had been taken for evaluation after putting coffee grounds and orange peels on her head. She told the staff about television cameras in her closet that spied upon her whenever she had sex. Since then, she had had several additional episodes, widely scattered across 25 74 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS years. Whenever she fell ill, her symptoms were the same. Each time she recovered enough to return home to her husband. Every morning Ramona\u2019s husband had to prepare a list spelling out her day\u2019s activi- ties, even including meal planning and cooking. Without it, he might arrive home to find that she had accomplished nothing that day. The couple had no children and few friends. Ramona\u2019s most recent evaluation was prompted by a change in medical care plans. Her new clinician noted that she was still taking neuroleptics; each morning her hus - band carefully counted them out onto her plate and watched her swallow them. During the interview, she winked and smiled when it did not seem appropriate. She said it had been several years since television cameras bothered her, but she wondered whether her closet \u201cmight be haunted.\u201d Evaluation of Ramona Kelt Ramona had been ill for many years with symptoms that included disorganized behav- ior (criterion A4) and a delusion about television cameras (A1). The diagnosis of disor - ganized (hebephrenic) schizophrenia would at one time have been warranted, based on her inappropriate affect and bizarre speech (A3) and behavior. When acutely ill, she also met DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia. At this evaluation she was between acute episodes, but showed peculiarities of affect (winking) and ideation (the closet might be haunted) that suggested attenuated psychotic symptoms. She did have one serious, ongoing negative symptom (A5), avolition: If her husband didn\u2019t plan her day for her, she would accomplish pretty close to nothing (this would earn her a GAF score of 51). However, with only one current psychotic symptom, she appeared to be partly recovered from her last episode of schizophrenia. Of course, to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, Ramona would have to have none of the exclusions (general medical conditions, substance- induced psychotic dis- order, mood disorders, schizoaffective disorder). I think we would be pretty safe in assuming that this was still the case, so her current diagnosis would be as given below. Note, too,",

I think we would be pretty safe in assuming that this was still the case, so her current diagnosis would be as given below. Note, too, that even the sketchy information in the vignette nicely fulfilled our typical schizophrenia prototype. The course specifier equates essentially to the old diagnosis of schizophrenia, residual type. F20.9 [295.90] Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, currently in partial remission Psychotic Disorders Other Than Schizophrenia F20.81 [295.40] Schizophreniform Disorder Its name sounds as if it must be related to schizophrenia, but the diagnosis of schizo - phreniform disorder (SphD) was devised in the late 1930s to deal with patients who may Schizophreniform Disorder 75 have something quite different. These people look as if they do have schizophrenia, but some of them later recover completely with no residual effects. The SphD diagnosis is valuable because it prevents closure: It alerts all clinicians that the underlying nature of the patient\u2019s psychosis has not yet been proven. (The -form suffix means this: The symp- toms look like schizophrenia, which it may turn out to be. But with limited information, the careful clinician feels uncomfortable rushing into a diagnosis that implies lifelong disability and treatment.) The symptoms and exclusions required for SphD are identical to those of basic schizophrenia; where the two diagnoses differ is in terms of duration and dysfunc - tion. DSM-5 doesn\u2019t require evidence that SphD has interfered with the patient\u2019s life. However, when you think about it, most people who have had delusions and hallucina- tions for a month or more have probably suffered some inconvenience socially or in the workplace. The real distinguishing point is the length of time the patient has been symp - tomatic: From 1 to 6 months is the period required. The practical importance of the interval is this: Numerous studies have shown that psychotic patients who have been briefly ill have a much better chance of full recovery than do those who have been ill for 6 months or longer. Still, over half of those who are initially diagnosed as having SphD are eventually found to have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. SphD isn\u2019t really a discrete disease at all; it\u2019s a place filler that\u2019s used about equally for males and females who are of about the age as",

SphD isn\u2019t really a discrete disease at all; it\u2019s a place filler that\u2019s used about equally for males and females who are of about the age as patients with schizophrenia when they are first diagnosed. The diagnosis is made only about one-fifth as often as schizo - phrenia is, especially in the United States and other Western countries. In the late 1930s, the n orwegian psychiatrist Gabriel Langfeldt coined the term schizo - phreniform psychosis. In the United States it was perhaps more relevant at that time, when the diagnosis of schizophrenia was so often made for patients who had psychotic symptoms but not the longitudinal course typical of schizophrenia. a s Langfeldt made clear in a 1982 letter in the American Journal of Psychiatry, when he devised the concept he meant to include not only psychoses that look exactly like schizophrenia except for the duration of symptoms, but other presentations as well. These include what we would today call brief psychosis, schizoaffective disorders, and even some bipolar disorders. Time and custom have narrowed the meaning of his term, to the point where it is hardly ever used. I consider that to be a great pity; it\u2019s a useful device that helps keep clinicians on their toes and patients off chronic dosing with medication. 76 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Essential Features of Schizophreniform Disorder Relatively rapid onset and offset characterize SphD. The term usually indicates a young person (late teens or 20s) who for 30 days to 6 months has (1) delusions (espe- cially persecutory) and (2) hallucinations (especially auditory). However, some patients will have (3) speech that is incoherent or otherwise disorganized, (4) severely abnor- mal psychomotor behavior (catatonic symptoms), or (5) negative symptoms such as restricted affect or lack of volition (they don\u2019t feel motivated to do work or maintain family life). Diagnosis requires at least two of these five types of psychotic symptoms, at least one of which must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The patient recovers fully within 6 months.

You may specify severity, though you don\u2019t have to (see p. 74). Arnold Wilson When he was 3, Arnold Wilson\u2019s family had entered a witness protection program. At least that\u2019s what he told the mental health intake interviewer. Arnold was slim, of medium height, and clean- shaven. He wore a name tag identi- fying him as a medical student. His eye contact was direct and steady, and he sat quietly as he described his experiences. \u201cIt was on account of my dad,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen we lived back East, he used to be in the Mob.\u201d Schizophreniform Disorder 77 Arnold\u2019s father, the principal informant, later remarked, \u201cOK, I\u2019m an investment banker. You might think that\u2019s bad enough, but it isn\u2019t the Mob. Well, anyway, it\u2019s not that mob.\u201d Arnold\u2019s ideas had come to him as a revelation 2 months earlier. He was at his desk, studying for a physiology test, when he heard a voice just behind him. \u201cI jumped up, thinking I must have left my door open, but there was no one in the room but me. I checked the radio and my iPod, but everything was turned off. Then I heard it again.\u201d The voice was one he recognized. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you whose. She told me not to.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice spoke very clearly to him and seemed to move around a lot. \u201cSome- times she seemed like she was just behind me. Other times, she stood outside whatever room I was in.\u201d He agrees that she spoke in complete sentences.",
    "you whose. She told me not to.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice spoke very clearly to him and seemed to move around a lot. \u201cSome- times she seemed like she was just behind me. Other times, she stood outside whatever room I was in.\u201d He agrees that she spoke in complete sentences. \u201cSometimes full para- graphs. What a gabby person!\u201d he remarked with a laugh. At first, the voice told him he \u201cneeded to cover my tracks, whatever that meant.\u201d When he tried to ignore it, she became \u201creally angry, told me to believe her, or . . . \u201d Arnold didn\u2019t finish the sentence. The voice pointed out that his last name, before he was 3, was Italian. \u201cYou know, she was really beginning to make sense.\u201d \u201cThe name change part\u2019s true,\u201d his father explained. \u201cWhen I married his mother, Arnold was part of the deal. His biological father had died of cancer of the kidney. We both thought it would be best if I adopted him.\u201d That was 20 years ago. Arnold had had difficulty in middle school. His attention wandered, and so did he. As a result, he spent a lot of time in the principal\u2019s office. Although several teachers despaired of him, in high school he\u2019d hit his stride. There he\u2019d made excellent grades, gotten into a good college, and then been accepted at a better medical school. That autumn, just before starting his freshman year, his physical exam (and a panel of blood tests) had been completely normal. He said his roommate would testify that he hadn\u2019t used any drugs or alcohol. \u201cIt was pretty confusing, at first\u2014the voice, I mean. I wondered if I was losing my mind. But then we talked it over, she and I. Now it seems pretty clear.\u201d When Arnold talked about the voice, he became quite animated, using appro - priate hand gestures and vocal inflections. Throughout, he gave full attention to the interviewer, except once when he turned his head, as though listening to something. Or someone. Evaluation of Arnold Wilson Arnold\u2019s two psychotic symptoms\u2014 delusions and auditory hallucinations\u2014are enough to get us past the criterion A requirements, which are the same for SphD as for schizo- phrenia.

The vignette doesn\u2019t describe the extent to which his social or school function- ing had been compromised, but the SphD criteria set doesn\u2019t require this information. The clinical features of Arnold\u2019s psychosis closely resembled those of schizophre- nia. Of course, that\u2019s the whole point of SphD: At the time you make the diagnosis, you don\u2019t know whether the outcome will be full recovery or long-term illness. Arnold\u2019s 78 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS symptoms had been present too long for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts less than 1 month, and too briefly for schizophrenia. He didn\u2019t use alcohol to excess, and on his roommate\u2019s evidence (OK, by proxy), he didn\u2019t use drugs at all; this would rule out a substance- induced psychotic disorder. The usual general medical causes of psychosis would have to be investigated, but his recent physical exam had been normal. With no symptoms of mania or depression, bipolar I disorder would seem vanishingly unlikely. Whenever possible for patients with SphD, a statement of prognosis should be made. In Arnold\u2019s case, the treating clinician noted the following evidence of good prognosis: (1) As far as anyone could tell, his illness had begun abruptly with prominent psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations). (2) His premorbid functioning (both work and social life) had been good. (3) Lacking flattening or inappropriateness, his affect was intact during this evaluation. The fourth good- prognosis feature specified by DSM-5 is perplexity or confusion. Arnold did say that he was confused at first, but by the time of his evaluation, at the height of his illness, his cognitive processes seemed intact. Thus he had three of the features that favor a good prognosis; only two are needed. The criteria require that a qualifier of (provisional) be appended if the diagnosis of SphD is made before the patient recovers, as was the case for Arnold. Assuming that he recovered completely within the 6-month limit, this qualifier could then be removed. However, if the illness lasted longer than 6 months and it interfered with Arnold\u2019s work or social life, the diagnosis might need to be changed\u2014 probably to schizophrenia. Right now, Arnold\u2019s diagnosis should read as given below. And I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 60: Though his psychotic symptoms were serious, his behavior hadn\u2019t been markedly affected.

F20.81 [295.40] Schizophreniform disorder (provisional), with good prognostic features Do you need a place to park your patient while you collect more evidence? Even in DSM-5, there persist a couple of diagnostic \u201csidings\u201d that you can use to indicate that something is wrong, but you\u2019re waiting for more information before you commit to a diagnosis. Of course, there\u2019s always \u201cother specified \u201d or \u201cunspecified ,\u201d but even beyond those useful (and vague, and sometimes indiscriminately used) locutions, we have some other terms that gain much the same advantage. SphD is one\u2014it can go either way, to chronicity or to recovery. and then brief psy- chotic disorder was manufactured to cover the month of psychosis before you can diag - nose SphD. In chapter 6, we\u2019ll see that acute stress disorder was cobbled together to cover the month before posttraumatic stress disorder can be diagnosed. b ut that\u2019s about the sum of it. The problem is, we mental health clinicians are still dependent on our patients\u2019 appearance to inform how we view them. Other medical disciplines use lab tests, and so may avoid the diagnostic way station. Schizophreniform Disorder 79 F23 [298.8] Brief Psychotic Disorder Patients with brief psychotic disorder (BPsD) are psychotic for at least 1 day and return to normal within 1 month. It doesn\u2019t matter how many symptoms they have had or whether they have had trouble functioning socially or at work. (In parallel with schizo- phreniform disorder, any patient who remains symptomatic longer than 1 month must be given a different diagnosis.) BPsD isn\u2019t an especially stable diagnosis; many patients will eventually be redi - agnosed with another psychotic disorder. (This is hardly surprising for a diagnosis you can have for only 30 days.). As few as 7% of first-time patients with psychotic disorders have this as the initial diagnosis. Some patients who experience a psychosis around the time of giving birth may be given this diagnosis. Even then, it is a rare condition: The incidence of postpartum psychosis is only about 1 or 2 per 1,000 women who give birth. Indeed, BPsD is overall twice as",
    "the initial diagnosis. Some patients who experience a psychosis around the time of giving birth may be given this diagnosis. Even then, it is a rare condition: The incidence of postpartum psychosis is only about 1 or 2 per 1,000 women who give birth. Indeed, BPsD is overall twice as common among women as men. European clinicians are more likely to diagnose BPsD. (This doesn\u2019t mean that the condition occurs more frequently in Europe, just that European clinicians are appar - ently more alert to it\u2014or more likely to overdiagnose it.) BPsD may be more common among young patients (teenagers and young adults) and among patients who are from lower socioeconomic strata or who have preexisting personality disorders. Patients with certain personality disorders (such as borderline) who have very brief psychotic symp- toms precipitated by stress do not require a separate diagnosis of BPsD. Over two decades ago, in DSM-III-R, this category was called brief reactive psy - chosis. That name and its criteria reflected the notion that it may occur in response to some overwhelmingly stressful event, such as death of a relative. In the DSM-5 criteria, this concept is retained only in the form of specifiers. The decision about the diagnosis of bPsD is relatively straightforward. To compensate, we face decisions about specifiers that are fraught. We must determine whether a stressor could have caused the psychosis. Of course, anything could precede the onset, and to learn what it might be could require interviewing a spouse, relative, or friend. We\u2019d want to learn about possible traumatic events, but also about the patient\u2019s premorbid adjustment, past history of similar reactions to stress, and the chronological relationship between stressor and the onset of symptoms. Even with all this, we\u2019re still stuck with deciding whether the event is likely to have caused psychosis. DSM-5 tells us only that the event(s) must be severe enough to cause stress for anyone of the patient\u2019s situation and culture. b ut it doesn\u2019t help us at all to decide whether psychosis is in response to stress. My solution: Ignore the words in response; if there\u2019s marked stress, say so, and move on. 80 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Essential Features of Brief Psychotic Disorder All within the course of a single month, the patient develops, then recovers com - pletely from an episode of psychosis that includes delusions, hallucinations, or dis - organized speech",

Melanie Grayson This was Melanie Grayson\u2019s first pregnancy, and she had been quite apprehensive about it. She had gained 30 pounds, and her blood pressure had been slightly too high. But she had needed only a spinal block for anesthesia, and her husband was in the room with her when she delivered a healthy baby girl. That night she slept fitfully; she was irritable the next day. But she breastfed her baby and seemed to listen attentively when the nurse practitioner came to instruct her on bathing and other postpartum care. The next morning, while Melanie was having breakfast, her husband came to take her and the baby home. When she ordered him to turn off the radio, he looked around the room and said he didn\u2019t hear one. \u201cYou know very well what radio,\u201d she yelled, and threw a tea bag at him. The mental health consultant noted that Melanie was alert, fully oriented, and cognitively intact. She was irritable but not depressed. She kept insisting that she heard a radio playing: \u201cI think it\u2019s hidden in my pillow.\u201d She unzipped the pillowcase and felt around inside. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of a news report. They\u2019re talking about what\u2019s happening in the hospital. I think I just heard my name mentioned.\u201d Brief Psychotic Disorder 81 Melanie\u2019s flow of speech was coherent and",

They\u2019re talking about what\u2019s happening in the hospital. I think I just heard my name mentioned.\u201d Brief Psychotic Disorder 81 Melanie\u2019s flow of speech was coherent and relevant. Apart from throwing the tea bag and looking for the radio, her behavior was unremarkable. She denied hallucina - tions involving any of the other senses. She insisted that the voices she heard could not be imaginary, and she didn\u2019t think someone was trying to play a trick on her. She had never used drugs or alcohol, and her obstetrician vouched for her excellent general health. After much discussion, she agreed to remain in the hospital a day or two longer to try to get to the bottom of the mystery. Evaluation of Melanie Grayson Despite her obvious psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), the brevity of her symp- toms kept Melanie from meeting the criterion A requirements for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. What\u2019s left? Although Melanie remained alert and cognitively intact, any patient with abrupt onset of psychotic symptoms should be carefully evaluated for a possible delirium. (They will often be confused, which may be the fact with patients who have BPsD, too. Be careful in your evaluation.) Many general medical conditions can also produce psychotic symptoms. Anyone who becomes psychotic soon after entering the hospital should be evaluated for a substance- induced psychotic disorder with onset during withdrawal. Melanie had no prominent mood symptoms; if she had had any, a diagnosis of a mood disorder with psychotic features might have been entertained. It is worth noting that many patients who develop psychosis after delivery may have mixtures of symptoms that include euphoria, psychosis, and cognitive changes. Many of these patients have some form of mood disorder (often bipolar I disorder ). Diagnosis should be made with extreme care in all cases of postpartum psychosis; the diagnosis of schizophrenia should never be made, except in the most obvious and cer - tain of circumstances. With a very brief duration of psychosis and none of the exclusions, Melanie would fulfill the somewhat undemanding criteria for BPsD. Until she recovered, the diagnosis would have to be made provisionally. I\u2019d put her GAF score at 40. Her full diagnosis at this time would be as follows: F23 [298.8] Brief psychotic disorder,",

Her full diagnosis at this time would be as follows: F23 [298.8] Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset (provisional) O80 [650] Normal delivery F22 [297.1] Delusional Disorder Persistent delusions are the chief characteristic of delusional disorder. Usually they can seem entirely believable; however, it is no longer necessary that they be nonbizarre, as DSM-IV required. Still, patients tend to appear pretty normal, as long as you don\u2019t touch on one of their delusions. There are half a dozen possible themes, which I\u2019ve out- lined in the Coding Notes. 82 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Although the symptoms can seem similar to those of schizophrenia, there are sev- eral reasons to list delusional disorder separately: \u2022\u2022 The age of onset is often later in life (mid- to late 30s) than that of schizophrenia. \u2022\u2022 Family histories of the two illnesses are dissimilar. \u2022\u2022 At follow-up, these patients are rarely rediagnosed as having schizophrenia. \u2022\u2022 The infrequent hallucinations take a back seat to the delusions, and are under - standable in the context of those delusions. Most importantly, compared to that of schizophrenia, the course of delusional dis- order is less fraught with intellectual and work- related deterioration. In fact, behav - ior won\u2019t be much altered, outside of responses to the delusions: for instance, phoning the police for protection, or letter- writing campaigns to complain of sundry imagined insults or infractions. As you might suppose, resulting domestic problems are fre - quent\u2014and, depending on their subtype, these patients may be swept up in litigation or endless medical tests. Delusional disorder is uncommon (by some estimates, schizophrenia is 30 times more frequent). Chronically reduced sensory input (being deaf or blind) may contrib - ute to its development, as may social isolation (such as being an immigrant in a strange country). Delusional disorder may also be associated with family traits that include suspiciousness, jealousy, and secretiveness. The persecutory type is by far the most common of the subtypes; the jealous type ranks a distant second. One problem that crops up frequently is the presence of mood symptoms in patients with delusional disorder. These may be quite unsurprisingly gloomy responses to the perception that others do not agree",
    "persecutory type is by far the most common of the subtypes; the jealous type ranks a distant second. One problem that crops up frequently is the presence of mood symptoms in patients with delusional disorder. These may be quite unsurprisingly gloomy responses to the perception that others do not agree with closely held beliefs. Depressive mood can create difficult questions of differential diagnosis: Most notably, does the patient have a primary mood disorder? The DSM-5 criteria do not provide a bright line separating the two concepts; the time course of two sets of symptoms\u2014mood and psychotic\u2014may help in the differentiation. Of course, in the case of serious question, I\u2019d consider first the more conservative mood disorder, though delusional disorder may look better and better as time passes. Shared Delusions Though such instances are extremely rare, cases in which one or more persons develop delusions as a result of close association with another delusional person are dramatic and inherently interesting. DSM-IV called this condition shared psychotic disorder; as long ago as 150 years it was known as folie \u00e0 deux , which means \u201cdouble insanity.\u201d Usually two people are involved, but three, four, or more can become caught up in the delusion. Shared delusions affect women more often than men, and they usually occur within families. Social isolation may play a role in the development of this strange condition. Delusional Disorder 83 One of the persons affected is independently psychotic; through a close (and often dependent) association, the other has come to believe in the delusions and other expe- riences of the first. Though occasionally bizarre, the content of the delusion is usu - ally believable, if often unconvincing. Isolating the independently psychotic patient may cure the other(s), but this remedy doesn\u2019t always work. For one thing, the parties involved are often closely related and persist in reinforcing their mutual psychopathol- ogy. A few patients whose delusions mirror those of people with whom they are inti - mately associated will, for one reason or another, not fully qualify for a diagnosis of delusional disorder. For them, you\u2019ll have to use the category of other specified (or unspecified) schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, as described at the end of this chapter.

Molly McConegal Molly McConegal, a tiny sparrow of a woman, sat perched on the front of her waiting room chair. On her lap she tightly clutched a scuffed black handbag; her gray hair was caught up in a fierce little bun at the back of her head. Through spectacles as thick as highball glasses, she darted myopic, suspicious glances about the room. She had already spent 45 minutes with the consultant behind closed doors. Now she was wait - ing while her husband, Michael, had a turn. Michael confirmed much of what Molly had already said. The couple had been married for over 40 years, had two children, and had lived in the same neighborhood (the same house, in fact) nearly all of their married life. Both were retired from the telephone company, and they shared an interest in gardening. \u201cThat was where it all started, in the garden,\u201d said Michael. \u201cIt was last summer, when I was out trimming the rose bushes in the front yard. Molly said she caught me looking at the house across the street. The",

Molly said she caught me looking at the house across the street. The widow woman who lives there is younger than we are, maybe 50. We nod and say \u2018Hi,\u2019 but in 10 years, I\u2019ve never even been inside her front door. But Molly said I was taking too long on those rose bushes, that I was waiting for our neighbor\u2014her name is Mrs. Jessup\u2014to come out of the house. Of course, I denied it, but she insisted. Kept talking about it for days.\u201d In the following months, Molly pursued the idea of Michael\u2019s supposed extramari- tal relationship. At first she only suggested that he had been trying to lure Mrs. Jessup out for a meeting. Within a few weeks, she \u201cknew\u201d that they had been together. Soon this had become a sex orgy. Molly had talked of little else and had begun to incorporate many commonplace observations into her suspicions. A button undone on Michael\u2019s shirt meant that he had just returned from a visit with \u201cthe woman.\u201d The adjustment of the living room Venetian blinds tipped her off that he had been trying to semaphore messages the night before. A private detective Molly hired for surveillance only stopped by to chat with Michael, submitted a bill for $500, and resigned. Molly continued to do the cooking and washing for herself, but Michael now had to take care of his own meals and laundry. She slept normally, ate well, and\u2014when she wasn\u2019t with him\u2014seemed to be in good spirits. Michael, on the other hand, was becoming a nervous wreck. Molly listened in on his telephone calls and steamed open his mail. Once she told him that she would file for divorce, but she \u201cdidn\u2019t want the children to find out.\u201d Twice he had awakened at night to find her wrapped tightly in her bathrobe and standing beside his bed, glowering down at him. \u201cWaiting for me to Delusional Disorder 85 make my move,\u201d he said.

Since I had my prostate operation, I just haven\u2019t had the ability.\u201d Evaluation of Molly McConegal If you compare the features of delusional disorder with those of schizophrenia, you will note many differences. First, consider symptoms. Delusions are the only psychotic symptom found to any important degree in delusional disorder. The delusion could be any of the types listed in the Coding Notes. In Molly\u2019s case, they were of the jealous type, but the persecu - tory and grandiose types are also common. Note that with the exception of occasional olfactory or tactile hallucinations that support the content of delusions, patients with delusional disorder will never fulfill criterion A for schizophrenia (this nonfulfillment constitutes delusional disorder\u2019s criterion B). The delusions need last only 1 month; however, by the time they come to profes - sional attention, most patients, like Molly, have been ill much longer (A). The average age of patients may be around 55. The consequences are usually relatively mild for delusional disorder. Indeed, aside from the direct effects of the delusion (in Molly\u2019s case, her marital harmony), work and social life may not be affected much at all (C). However, the exclusions are pretty much the same as for schizophrenia. Always rule out another medical condition or cognitive disorder, especially a dementia with delusions, when evaluating delusional patients (D). This is especially important in older patients, who can be quite crafty at disguising the fact that they are cognitively impaired. Substance- induced psychotic disorders can closely mimic delusional disor- der. This is especially true for amphetamine- induced psychotic disorder with onset during withdrawal, in which fully oriented patients may describe how they are being attacked by gangs of pursuers (E).

Other than irritability in the company of her husband, she had no symptoms of a mood disorder. Even then, her affect was quite appropriate to her content of thought. However, many of these patients can develop mood syndromes secondary to the delu- sions. Then the diagnosis depends on the chronology and severity of mood symptoms. Information from relatives or other third parties is often required to determine which came first. Also, the mood symptoms must be relatively mild and brief to sustain a diag- nosis of delusional disorder. Although these patients may have associated conditions\u2014 including body dysmor- phic disorder, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, or avoidant, paranoid, or schizoid per- sonality disorder\u2014there was no evidence for any of these in Molly McConegal. Molly had been ill a bit less than a full year, so no course of illness could be speci- 86 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS fied. Her GAF score would be 55 (highest level in the past year). Her diagnosis would be as follows: F22 [297.1] Delusional disorder, jealous type Miriam Phillips Miriam Phillips was 23 when she was hospitalized. She had spent nearly all her life in the Ozarks, where she sometimes attended class in a three-room school. Although she was bright enough, she had little interest in her studies and often volunteered to stay home to care for her mother, who was unwell. She dropped out of 12th grade to stay home full-time. It was lonely living in the hills. Miriam\u2019s father, a long- distance trucker, was away most of the time. She had never learned to drive, and there were no close neighbors. Their television set received mostly snow; there was little in the way of mail; and there were no visitors at all. So she was surprised late on a Monday afternoon when two men paid a call. After identifying themselves as FBI agents, they asked if she was the Miriam Phil- lips who 3 weeks earlier had written a letter to the president. When she asked how they had known, they showed her a faxed copy of her own letter: Dear Mr. President, what do you plan to do about the Cubans? They have been work- ing on mother.

Their up to no good. Ive seen the police, but they say Cubans are your job, and I guess their right. You have to do your job or Ill have a dirty job to do. Miriam Phillips. When Miriam finally figured out that the FBI agents thought she had threatened the president, she relaxed. She hadn\u2019t meant that at all. She had meant that if no one else took action, she\u2019d have to crawl under the house to get the gravity machines. \u201cGravity machines?\u201d The two agents looked at each other. She explained. They had been installed under the house by Cuban agents of Fidel Castro after the Bay of Pigs invasion in the 1960s. The machines pulled your body fluids down toward your feet. They hadn\u2019t affected her yet, but they had bothered her mother for years. Miriam had seen the hideous swelling in her mother\u2019s ankles. Some days it extended almost to her knees. The two agents listened to her politely, then left. As they passed through town on their way to the airport, they called at the local community mental health clinic. Within a few days, a mental health worker came to interview Miriam, who agreed to enter the hospital voluntarily for a \u201ccheckup.\u201d On admission, Miriam appeared remarkably intact. She had a full range of appro - priate affect and normal cognitive abilities and orientation. Her reasoning ability seemed good, aside from the story about the gravity machines. As far back as her teens, her mother had told her how the machines came to be installed in the crawlspace under Delusional Disorder 87 their house. Mother had been a nurse, and Miriam had always accepted her word in medical matters. By some unspoken agreement, the two had never discussed the mat - ter with Miriam\u2019s father. After Miriam had been on the ward for 3 days, her clinician asked whether she thought any other explanation for her mother\u2019s edema was possible. Miriam considered. She had never felt the gravity effects herself. She had believed that her mother told her the truth, but she now supposed that even Mother could have been mistaken.

    "thought any other explanation for her mother\u2019s edema was possible. Miriam considered. She had never felt the gravity effects herself. She had believed that her mother told her the truth, but she now supposed that even Mother could have been mistaken. Though Miriam was given no medication, after a week she stopped talking about gravity machines and asked to be discharged. At the end of their shift that afternoon, two young attendants gave her a lift home. As they walked her to the front door, it was opened by a short woman, quite stout, with salt-and- pepper hair. Her lower legs were neatly wrapped in elastic bandages. Through the partly opened door she darted a glance at the two men. \u201cHmmm!\u201d she said. \u201cYou look like Cubans.\u201d Evaluation of Miriam Phillips Though we don\u2019t know exactly how long, Miriam had had delusions far longer than a month (criterion A) without hallucinations or negative symptoms, and with no disor - dered behavior or affect. Therefore, schizophrenia could be ruled out just on the basis of insufficient variety of symptoms (B). She wasn\u2019t depressed or manic (D), and there was no history or other evidence to support substance- induced psychotic disorder or psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (E). Her delusions hadn\u2019t caused any occupational or social dysfunction; her own isolation appeared to have begun at least 5 years earlier, before the onset of her shared delusion (C). With an admission GAF score of 40, Miriam\u2019s delusions became less prominent after just a few days of separation from her mother. (If they had persisted for a long time, the diagnosis of a different, independent psychosis would have been considered.) In working further with her, a therapist would also want to consider the possibility of a personality disorder, such as dependent personality disorder. Her delusion, and that of her mother, was certainly bizarre, but I\u2019m not confident she had been ill longer than a year, so I wouldn\u2019t give her any other specifiers. F22 [297.1] Delusional disorder, persecutory type, with bizarre content Schizoaffective Disorder Schizoaffective disorder (SaD) is just plain confusing.

    "Carpenter, chairperson of the DSM-5 psychosis study group, stated during a 2013 presentation about his com- mittee\u2019s work, \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if it exists in nature.\u201d) Over the years, it has meant many different things to clinicians. Partly because there were so many interpretations in use, DSM-III included no criteria at all in 1980. DSM-III-R first attempted to spec- ify criteria in 1987. These endured for 7 years, until they were substantially rewritten 88 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS for DSM-IV. Showing admirable restraint, DSM-5 has made relatively few changes to those criteria. Even with the (minimal) tweaking of criteria, in my opinion the value of this diagnosis remains pretty low. Most interpretations suggest that SaD is some sort of cross between a mood dis - order and schizophrenia. Some writers regard it as a form of bipolar disorder, because certain patients seem to respond well to lithium. Other commentators believe that it is closer to schizophrenia. Still others hold that it is an entirely separate type of psychosis, or simply a collection of confusing, sometimes contradictory symptoms. With its various percentage and minimal time requirements, SaD could unfold in a variety of ways: mania first, depression first, psychosis first. Of course, there are the usual exclusions for substance use and general medical conditions. If you examine the various time requirements, you can determine that the entire illness must last at minimum for a bit longer than 1 month, though many patients will be ill much longer. No one really knows much about the demographic features of SaD. It is probably less common than schizophrenia; its prognosis lies between that of schizophrenia and the mood disorders. Recent studies indicate that patients with SaD whose manic symp- toms predominate (the bipolar type) may have a better prognosis than those with the depressive type of this condition. I find it easier to remember the requirements for SaD if I think of them as follows: The mood symptoms are important in that they must be present during half or more of the total duration of illness. The psychosis symptoms are important in that they must be present by themselves for at least 2 weeks. (note that the criteria are silent on whether to count psychosis symptoms that are present during the time that mood symptoms have disappeared under treatment.) In this graphic representation of the minimum time requirements that are possible,",
    "in that they must be present by themselves for at least 2 weeks. (note that the criteria are silent on whether to count psychosis symptoms that are present during the time that mood symptoms have disappeared under treatment.) In this graphic representation of the minimum time requirements that are possible, given the criteria, the overall length of the box represents the totality of the individual\u2019s ill- ness, not just an episode. Of course, it will be impossible for any clinician to know whether the criteria for a mood episode are met throughout the illness; we\u2019ll have to rely on proto - types for the overall gestalt. 2 weeks (psychosis) 2+ more weeks (mood episode) note that the \u201csolo\u201d psychotic episode (criterion a ) could come at any point in the episode: the start, the end, somewhere in the middle. Unhappily, DSM-5 is silent on the question of whether, during the psychosis period, there can be mood symptoms that don\u2019t fully qualify as an episode of mania, hypomania, or depression. (DSM-IV was more forth - right; it said \u201cin the absence of prominent mood symptoms.\u201d) Start saving for DSM-6. Schizoaffective Disorder 89 Essential Features of Schizoaffective Disorder A patient has a period of illness during which a manic episode or a major depressive episode lasts half of more of the total time involved. For at least a fortnight dur - ing this same continuous period, the patient fulfills the criterion A requirements for schizophrenia without having a mood episode.

First she grasped it in her hand, with her thumb along the blade. Then she tried clutching it in her fist. The therapist reached for the alarm button under the desk top, ruefully aware of yet another change of course in this patient\u2019s multifaceted history. A month before her 18th birthday, Velma Dean had joined the Army. Her father, a colonel of artillery, had wanted a son, but Velma was his only child. Over the feeble pro- tests of her mother, Velma\u2019s upbringing had been strict and semimilitary. After working 3 years in the motor pool, Velma herself had just been promoted to sergeant when she became ill. Her illness started with 2 days in the infirmary for what seemed like bronchitis, but as the penicillin took effect and her fever resolved, the voices began. At first they seemed to be located toward the back of her head. Within a few days they had moved to her bedside water glass. As nearly as she could tell, their pitch depended on the con- tents of her glass: If the glass was nearly empty, the voices were female; if it was full to the top, they spoke in a rich baritone. They were always quiet and mannerly. Often they gave her advice on how to behave, but at times she said they \u201cnearly drove me crazy\u201d by constantly commenting on what she was doing. A psychiatrist diagnosed Velma\u2019s condition as schizophrenia and prescribed neu - roleptics. The voices improved, but never quite disappeared. She concealed the fact that she had \u201cfigured out\u201d that her illness had been caused by her first sergeant, who for months had tried unsuccessfully to get her into bed. She also hid the fact that for several weeks she had been drinking nearly a pint of Southern Comfort each evening. The Army retired her as medically unfit, 100% disabled.

    "her first sergeant, who for months had tried unsuccessfully to get her into bed. She also hid the fact that for several weeks she had been drinking nearly a pint of Southern Comfort each evening. The Army retired her as medically unfit, 100% disabled. When she was well enough to travel, her father drove her the 600 miles back home. For her treatment, Velma enrolled at her local Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient clinic. There, her new therapist verified (1) the continuing presence (now for nearly 8 months) of her barely audible hallucinations, and (2) her increasingly profound symptoms of depression. These included low self- esteem and hopelessness (much worse in the morning than in the evening); loss of appetite; a 10-pound weight loss over the past 8 weeks; insomnia that caused her to awaken early most mornings; and the guilty conviction that she had disappointed her father by \u201cdeserting\u201d the Army before her hitch was up. She denied thoughts of injuring herself or other people. Velma\u2019s VA clinician initially deferred making a diagnosis, noting that she had been ill too long for schizophreniform disorder and that her mood symptoms seemed to argue against schizophrenia. Physical exam and laboratory testing ruled out gen - eral medical conditions. Although Alcoholics Anonymous helped her stop drinking, her depressive and psychotic symptoms continued. Because Velma\u2019s depressive symptoms might be secondary to a partly treated psy- chosis, her neuroleptic dose was increased. This completely eliminated the hallucina - tions and delusions, but the depressive symptoms continued virtually unabated. The antidepressant imipramine at 200 mg/day only produced side effects; after 4 weeks, lithium was added. Once a therapeutic blood level was reached, her depressive symp - Schizoaffective Disorder 91 toms melted completely away. For 6 months she remained in a good mood and free of psychosis, though she never obtained a job or did very much with her time. Now it seemed that Velma might actually be suffering from a major depressive disorder with psychotic features. At this point, her clinician became uneasy that the neuroleptic could produce side effects such as tardive dyskinesia. With Velma\u2019s con - sent, the neuroleptic was gradually reduced by about 20% per week. After 3 weeks, she began once again to hear voices commanding her to run away from home. Dur - ing this time her mood remained good; with the exception of some difficulty getting to sleep",
    "With Velma\u2019s con - sent, the neuroleptic was gradually reduced by about 20% per week. After 3 weeks, she began once again to hear voices commanding her to run away from home. Dur - ing this time her mood remained good; with the exception of some difficulty getting to sleep at night, she developed none of the vegetative symptoms she had formerly had with depression. Her full former dose of neuroleptic medication was rapidly restored. After several months of renewed stability, Velma and her therapist decided to try again. This time they began cautiously to reduce the imipramine, by 25 mg each week. Each week they met to evaluate her mood and check for symptoms of psychosis. By December she had been free of the antidepressant for 2 months, and had remained symptom-free (except for her habitual bland, smiling affect). Now her therapist took a deep breath and decreased her lithium by one tablet per day. The following week Velma returned to the office, hallucinating and wondering whether to hold a kitchen knife in her hand or in her fist. Evaluation of Velma Dean With Velma\u2019s story, we can illustrate the current thinking about SaD. Her condition really seemed to be a mixture of mood and psychotic symptoms, though the latter had clearly begun first. She had what appeared to be a single period of illness (her only \u201cwell\u201d periods were when she was taking medication; even then, she had residual lack of initiative), with both psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations and a delusion that the sergeant had caused her illness) and a major depressive episode (criterion A). Dur- ing this period her mood symptoms, which occurred both with and without psychotic symptoms, had lasted for more than half the duration of her total illness (C). Although she abused alcohol at one time during her illness, it appeared to be a consequence of her illness, not the cause; both her mood and psychotic symptoms continued long after she quit drinking (D). The psychosis had begun first and had lasted at least 2 weeks before the mood symptoms commenced (B). The prototype symptoms are also met at level 4, and say more or less the same thing. Although we can rattle off these criteria with relative ease (and, to be honest, a crib sheet), Velma\u2019s history illustrates how difficult it can be to apply them.

Although we can rattle off these criteria with relative ease (and, to be honest, a crib sheet), Velma\u2019s history illustrates how difficult it can be to apply them. The therapist, whose thinking has already been described in the vignette, was smart initially to defer diagnosis; this should remind all clinicians to keep thinking about the diagnosis and to reject any label that might close their minds to further therapeutic plans. She could not be diagnosed as having schizophrenia , because it excludes prominent, lasting mood episodes. A mood disorder with psychosis could be eliminated because she had psy - 92 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS chotic symptoms even when not depressed. After many months of care, she showed no evidence of another medical condition. The relative duration of psychosis and mood symptoms is very important in SaD. DSM-5 states that the mood symptoms must be present for a majority of the overall duration of illness. Velma\u2019s depressive symptoms lasted for at least 2 months; there is every reason to suspect they would have gone on much longer had she not received effective treatment. Her criterion A symptoms for schizophrenia had been present for 2 weeks without mood symptoms. However carefully the criteria try to operationalize the duration of various symptoms, it remains to some degree a judgment call on the part of each clinician. (DSM-5 is silent on the issue of treated depression and SaD; I\u2019m claiming clinician\u2019s prerogative and declaring that because antidepressant treatment seems to have made all the difference, SaD should be her diagnosis.) Eventually, many patients with both mood and psychotic symptoms will comfort - ably fit the criteria for schizophrenia or a mood disorder. If they were followed long enough, perhaps the majority of patients with SaD could be rediagnosed. Given the highly restrictive nature of the current definition, it seems likely that this diagnosis will rarely be used. If you ever make the diagnosis, ask yourself, \u201cHave I overlooked anything that is more reasonable?\u201d SaD is a diagnosis best used for patients who have a long- standing history of both sets of symptoms. Other specified (or unspecified) schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder may prove to be much more useful to most clinicians.

F25.1 [295.70] Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type Substance/Medication- Induced Psychotic Disorder This category includes all psychoses caused by mind- altering substances. The pre - dominant symptoms are usually hallucinations or delusions; depending on the sub - stance, they can occur during withdrawal or acute intoxication. Usually the course is brief, though they can persist long enough to cause confusion with endogenous psychoses. Although most of these psychoses are self- limiting, early recognition is crucial. Patients have died while experiencing a substance- induced psychotic disorder, several of which can closely mimic schizophrenia. Many diagnoses are possible, if we include all the possible combinations of different substances with the type and duration of psy- chosis and its relation to intoxication or withdrawal. The incidence is unknown, though a substantial minority of first- episode psychoses may belong to this class\u2014enough that we should remain alert for them. See the \u201cClasses (or Names) of Medications . . .\u201d table in the Appendix for a list of medications associated with psychosis. Substance/Medication- Induced Psychotic Disorder 93 Essential Features of Substance/Medication- Induced Psychotic Disorder The use of some substance appears to have caused hallucinations or delusions (or both). The Fine Print For tips on identifying substance- related causation, see sidebar, page 95.

Coding Notes When writing down the diagnosis, use the name of the exact substance in the title: for example, methamphetamine- induced psychotic disorder. ICD-9 kept coding simple: 291.9 for alcohol, 292.9 for all other substances.

You can use this in addition to other specifiers (see the sidebar just below). You may specify severity, though you don\u2019t have to (see p. 74). Actually, DSM-5 mentions with onset after medication use as an optional specifier for sub- stance/medication- induced anxiety disorder, obsessive\u2013 compulsive and related disorder, and sexual dysfunctions, but not for psychotic, mood, or sleep disorders. (This despite the fact that the titles of these disorders even begin, uniformly, \u201csubstance/medication- induced [this or that].\u201d) I am told that there wasn\u2019t enough communication among the different subcommit - tees, so that inconsistencies such as this one crept into the final version.

Danny Finch Danny Finch put up with the ear problem for 3 days before he finally called for an appointment.

But what about my ear?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal.\u201d \u201cBut I hear something. It\u2019s like someone chanting. I can almost make out what they\u2019re saying.

As he talked with the interviewer, he could hardly concentrate for the shouting: \u201cDon\u2019t tell about the drinking!\u201d and \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just kill yourself?\u201d He was so terrified that he accepted with relief a voluntary commitment to the mental health ward, where his admitting diagnosis was schizophrenia. Twice a day he was given a potent neuroleptic medication, which he tucked under his tongue and discarded in the tissue when he pretended to blow his nose. Danny slept soundly at night and cleaned his plate at every meal while the voices shouted on. At the end of the week, he was visited by a consultant who learned that the voices came from about 2 feet behind him and talked in sentences. Reluctantly, he admitted that they told him not to talk about his drinking. A rapid review of Danny\u2019s chart revealed no mention of alcohol use, but a little coaxing soon pried loose the whole story. Since his early 20s, there had been heavy drinking, loss of two jobs (he had a shaky hold on his present one), and a divorce, all related to his fondness for bourbon. Most recently he had been drinking more than a pint each evening, often a fifth on the weekends. Usually he managed to taper off; this time, he had quit suddenly after a bout of what he called \u201cthe stomach flu.\u201d DSM-5 repeatedly refers to classes of symptoms that may appear to be caused by a sub - stance. It is up to you to evaluate your patient for evidence that this might not be the case. Here are several findings, mostly based on chronology, that might constitute such evidence: Substance/Medication- Induced Psychotic Disorder 95 1. y our patient had a prior episode of the same, or very similar, symptoms that did not occur in the context of substance use. 2. The disorder continues long after the use of (or withdrawal from) the substance is over. 3. Rather obviously, a disorder that begins before substance use begins wouldn\u2019t be due to the substance use. 4. The symptoms are worse than you\u2019d expect, considering the amount and dura- tion of the substance misuse. none of these is exactly iron-clad. For example, a prior",
    "the substance is over. 3. Rather obviously, a disorder that begins before substance use begins wouldn\u2019t be due to the substance use. 4. The symptoms are worse than you\u2019d expect, considering the amount and dura- tion of the substance misuse. none of these is exactly iron-clad. For example, a prior history of major depressive disorder doesn\u2019t confer subsequent immunity to depression that originates in a bottle of Scotch. Still, the cues are there, for your thoughtful consideration. and here are some of the reasons why you should consider a substance-use causa- tion: 1. The symptoms begin soon after (or during) the use of a substance or its with - drawal. 2. They start after a patient has begun use of a medication. 3. The drug/medication is known to be capable of causing the symptoms in ques- tion. 4. Of course, if your patient has had a prior episode of the same symptoms that did follow the use of the same substance, that\u2019s perhaps the best evidence of all. Evaluation of Danny Finch Danny had auditory hallucinations (criterion A) that had been present far too briefly for schizophrenia, though he described them in similar terms (C). A brief psychotic disor- der might be possible, except for the requirement that a substance- induced psychotic disorder does not better explain the symptoms. He had just been seen by a physician, who pronounced him fit; there was no evidence of any other general medical condi - tion. The fact that he seemed fully oriented and maintained his attention would rule out delirium and other cognitive disorders (D). Though he appeared (appropriately) frightened by his experiences, he presented no evidence of mood disorder. Danny\u2019s psychosis\u2014in the distant past it was called alcoholic auditory halluci - nosis\u2014is a disorder of withdrawal that usually occurs only after weeks or months of heavy drinking (B). By about a 4:1 ratio, it occurs much more commonly in men than in women, approximating the sex ratio for alcohol use disorder itself. Auditory hallucinosis is sometimes misidentified as alcohol withdrawal delirium, though the problems with orientation and attention in the latter make the differences clear (see p. 483). Withdrawal from other drugs can also produce psychosis. Barbiturates , which 96 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS have many of the same effects as alcohol, are the most notorious of these.

His GAF score was only 35 on admission; his diagnosis (from Table 15.2 in Chapter 15) would be as follows: F10.259 [291.9] Severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol- induced psychotic disorder, with onset during withdrawal Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A psychosis arising in a patient who has another medical condition shouldn\u2019t be espe - cially rare. Many diseases can produce psychosis, and a number of them are rela - tively common. But few, if any, studies bear on questions of epidemiology. When such patients do appear, they are too often misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia or some other psychosis. This can lead to real tragedy: A patient who is not appropriately treated early enough may go on to experience (or cause) serious harm. Prevalence rates are not known exactly, but they\u2019re probably low; as you might imagine, frequency increases with age. Note that a patient with mainly disorganized behavior would instead be diagnosed as having catatonic disorder due to another medical condition. It\u2019s often a struggle to determine that a physical illness or medical condition has caused any mental disorder. Here are a few straws in the wind that can help out. \u2022\u2022 Timing of onset: Mental or behavioral symptoms that begin shortly after the start of the physical illness offer a pretty obvious etiological clue. \u2022\u2022 Remission follows treatment for the physical issue. \u2022\u2022 Proportionality of symptoms: a s the physical disorder worsens, so do the behav - ioral or emotional symptoms. \u2022\u2022 above all, there must be a known physiological connection between the physical condition and the symptom in question. That is, the physical disorder must be known to be capable of producing the symptom (for example, through produc- tion of chemicals, by impinging on brain structures).

    "physiological connection between the physical condition and the symptom in question. That is, the physical disorder must be known to be capable of producing the symptom (for example, through produc- tion of chemicals, by impinging on brain structures). It cannot simply be that the prospect of having a serious illness evokes psychosis, depression, anxiety, and so forth. OK, so these pointers aren\u2019t exactly iron-clad. Remember, they\u2019re straws, not steel.

Rodrigo Chavez After he retired from teaching at age 65, Rodrigo Chavez spent most of his time sitting alone in his room. Sometimes he played the acoustic guitar; once or twice he shot tar - gets at the rifle range. True to his lifelong habit, he never drank. Other than his imme- diate family, he had few social contacts. \u201cMy cigarettes are my best friends,\u201d he put it during the forensic examination. When Rodrigo was nearly 70, an inoperable carcinoma of the lung was diagnosed. After a course of palliative radiotherapy, he declined further treatment and settled down in his apartment to die. Four months later, he first noticed right-sided headaches that would sometimes awaken him in the middle of the night. Because the doctors had told him he was terminally ill, he didn\u2019t seek further medical attention. Then he began to associate the headaches with natural gas, which he smelled coming out of the ven - tilator duct in his bathroom. When he called to report the problem to Mrs. Riordan, his landlady, she sent around the building\u2019s handyman, who could find nothing wrong. When his headaches and the odors increased, Rodrigo recalled that, weeks before, Mrs. Riordan had gone out several times to watch while",

When his headaches and the odors increased, Rodrigo recalled that, weeks before, Mrs. Riordan had gone out several times to watch while repairmen from the power company dug up the street outside the apartment building. The logical conclusion fairly burst upon him: His landlady was trying to poison him. 98 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS His anger mounted as the odor worsened. It had begun to affect his voice, which had become raspy and high- pitched. He had several shouted arguments with Mrs. Rior- dan. One of these they carried on through her apartment door at 2 a.m., several weeks after he first noticed the gas. He threatened to report her to the housing authority; she called him \u201ca crazy old coot.\u201d After he threatened her (\u201cIf I\u2019m not safe, your life isn\u2019t worth 15 cents!\u201d), they both made 911 telephone calls. The police could find nothing to charge anyone with and admonished them both to behave. The night he was arrested, Rodrigo had sat just inside his open doorway, yelling insults at Mrs. Riordan. When she lumbered to the top of the stairs to investigate, he shot her once, just behind her left ear. The arresting officers noted that he seemed \u201cstrangely detached\u201d from the murder of his landlady. One of them wrote down this statement: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter, just for me. But I couldn\u2019t stand her gassing all those other people in the house.\u201d The forensic examiner noted that Rodrigo Chavez was an elderly, slightly built man who was clean- shaven and neatly groomed. He was gaunt, looking as if he had lost considerable weight. His speech was clear, coherent, relevant, and spontaneous, but his voice was high- pitched and gravelly. He appeared calm, and he described his mood as \u201cmedium,\u201d but he became angry when describing his landlady\u2019s attempts to poison him. He was oriented to person, place, and time, and he earned a perfect score on the Mini- Mental State Exam. He was fully aware that he had lung cancer.

    "Mini- Mental State Exam. He was fully aware that he had lung cancer. Insight for the fact of his psychosis was nil, and his judgment by recent history had been extremely poor. An X-ray of his chest showed a right lung full of tumor; compared with a previous series, skull films suggested a metastatic lesion located in the right frontal lobe. Evaluation of Rodrigo Chavez Rodrigo Chavez was clearly psychotic: He had prominent olfactory hallucinations and an elaborate delusion about being poisoned. These had been present for several months (criterion A). (If insight is retained that the hallucinations and delusions are a product of the patient\u2019s own mind, one would generally not diagnose a psychotic disorder. Also note that, though Rodrigo\u2019s symptoms clearly met the criterion A inclusion require - ments for schizophrenia, they didn\u2019t have to: A person can qualify for this diagnosis with just one of either hallucinations or delusions.) Aside from his psychosis, Rodrigo\u2019s thinking was clear. He was oriented and he scored well on the Mini- Mental State Exam, so he had no evidence of a delirium or dementia (D). He had had no history of drinking or taking drugs, ruling out a substance- induced psychotic disorder. His mood had been at times angry, but appropriately so, given the content of his delusion and hallucination, so a mood disorder with psychotic features would also seem unlikely. There was no previous history of behavior or per - sonality change that would qualify him for a diagnosis of schizophrenia (C). Other features atypical for schizophrenia included the late age of onset and relatively brief duration. Schizophreniform disorder could be ruled out because another diagnosis Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 99 was more likely. Mrs. Riordan\u2019s unhappy end provides mute testimony to the clinical importance of his illness (E). Rodrigo had a history of a cancer that is known to metastasize to the brain; his headaches suggested that it had already done so. The findings on chest X-ray and MRI confirmed the diagnosis (B). His gravelly, high- pitched voice could be due to exten - sion of the growth or to another metastasis within his chest or neck. (Other medical conditions that can cause psychosis include temporal lobe epilepsy, primary [that is, not metastatic] brain tumors, endocrine disorders such as thyroid and adrenal disease, vitamin deficiency states, central nervous system syphilis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Wilson\u2019s",

Although Rodrigo had both hallucinations and delusions, the olfactory hallucina - tions appeared first and seemed to predominate, resulting in the diagnosis as recorded. My assessment of his GAF score was 15.

During the early part of the 20th century, each of these subtypes constituted about a third of all U.S. hospital admissions for schizophre- nia. Since that time, the prevalence of the catatonic type has declined markedly, so that it is now unusual to encounter such a patient on an acute care inpatient service. When it does occur, we would now call it catatonia associated with schizophrenia. F06.1 [293.89] Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition In recent decades, we\u2019ve come to realize that catatonia is more often found in associa - tion with various medical disorders. Most published accounts tend to describe only a handful of patients, but the responsible illnesses include viral encephalitis, subarach - noid hemorrhage, ruptured berry aneurysm in the brain, subdural hematoma, hyper - parathyroidism, arteriovenous malformation, temporal lobe tumors, akinetic mutism, and penetrating head wounds. There has even been a description of one patient who had a reaction to fluorides. A neurologist or mental health clinician who does a lot of consulting in a busy medical center may occasionally encounter a case. 100 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Catatonic symptoms (see sidebar below) are essentially the same, whether they occur in patients with a mood disorder, with schizophrenia, or with a physical disorder.

    "DISOrDErS Catatonic symptoms (see sidebar below) are essentially the same, whether they occur in patients with a mood disorder, with schizophrenia, or with a physical disorder. A patient with another medical condition is more likely to have the characteristic symp- toms of what is called retarded catatonia. These include posturing, catalepsy, and waxy flexibility. Such patients may also drool, stop eating, or become mute. The catatonic features usually associated with mania include hyperactivity, impulsivity, and combat- iveness. These patients may also refuse to keep their clothes on. Depressed patients may show markedly reduced mobility (even to the point of stupor), mutism, negativism, mannerisms, and stereotypies. Partly to save space, I\u2019ve omitted definitions of catatonic symptoms from my Essential Features for these two disorders and gathered them all into one convenient place: right here. Each of these behaviors tends to be a repeated rather than a one-off occurrence. Agitation. Excessive motor activity that appears to have neither a purpose nor an external cause. Stupor would be more or less the polar opposite. Catalepsy. Maintaining an uncomfortable posture, even when told it is not necessary. Echolalia. Verbatim repetition of someone else\u2019s words when another response is indicated. Echopraxia. Imitating another person\u2019s physical behavior, even when asked not to do so. Exaggerated compliance. at the slightest touch, moving in the direction indicated by another person (the old German term is mitgehen ). Grimace. Facial contortions not made in response to a noxious stimulus. Mannerisms. Repeated movements that seem to have a goal, but are excessive for the purpose. Mutism. absence of speech despite apparent physical ability to speak. Negativism. Without apparent motive, the patient offers resistance to passive move- ment or repeatedly turns away from the examiner. Posturing. Voluntarily assuming an unnatural or uncomfortable pose. Stereotypy. Repeated movement that is a nonessential part of goal- directed behav- ior. Waxy flexibility. Maintaining a position, even if uncomfortable, for several minutes or more, even if asked to change it. Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 101 Essential Features of Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier) The patient has prominent symptoms of catatonia, such as catalepsy, negativism, posturing, stupor, stereotypy, grimacing, echolalia, and others (see the sidebar above for definitions).

Edward Clapham Edward Clapham, a 43-year-old single man, was admitted to the university hospital\u2019s mental health service. He gave no chief complaint; he was entirely mute. He had been transferred from the state psychiatric hospital, where his diagnosis had been schizo - phrenia, catatonic type. For the past 8 years, he had not communicated by speech or writing. According to the transfer note, Edward had been intensively treated with neuro - leptics during his entire hospitalization, though none of these medications had relieved his basic symptoms. He reportedly spent the entire day every day lying on his back, toes pointing towards the foot of his bed, fists clenched and turned inward. From years of maintaining this position, he had developed severe muscle contractures at both ankles and both wrists. Most of the time he could be spoon-fed, but occasionally he refused to swallow and had to be fed by nasogastric tube. This had often been the case during the past 6 months; despite the tube feedings, he had lost about 30 pounds. Ten days earlier Edward had developed a high fever (104.6\u00b0F) and had been trans- ferred to the medical service, where the staff treated a Klebsiella pneumonia with tet- racycline. Subsequently he was moved to the mental health service, where this evalu - ation took place. Very little was known about Edward\u2019s background. He had been reared in the Midwest, the second child of a farm family. He may have attended some college, and he had worked for approximately 10 years as a tractor salesman. On admission, his mental status examination read as follows: 102 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Mr. Clapham lies flat on his back in bed. He is totally mute, so nothing can be learned of his thought content or flow of thought. Similarly, his cognitive processes, insight, and judgment cannot be assessed. His toes point down and his",
    "follows: 102 SCHIZOPHrENIA SPECTrUM AND OTHEr PSYCHOTIC DISOrDErS Mr. Clapham lies flat on his back in bed. He is totally mute, so nothing can be learned of his thought content or flow of thought. Similarly, his cognitive processes, insight, and judgment cannot be assessed. His toes point down and his fists are rotated inward. There is a noticeable tremor of his feet and his hands; he contracts the muscles of his arms and legs so strongly that they actually shake. Besides being mute, he shows other signs of catatonia. Negativism: When he is approached from one side, he gradually turns his head so that he gazes in the opposite direction. Catalepsy: When a limb is placed in any position (for instance, raised high above his head), he will maintain that position for several minutes, even if told that he can drop his hand. Waxy flexibility: Any attempt to bend his arm at the elbow, where there are no contractures, is met with resistance. It is evident that the biceps and triceps muscles are contracting together, causing motion at the joint to feel as if one were bending a rod made of wax or some other stiff substance. Grimacing: Every four or five minutes, he wrinkles his nose and purses his lips. This expression lasts for 10 or 15 seconds, then relaxes. There is no apparent purpose to these motions, and they are not accompanied by any motions of the tongue or other indications of tardive dyskinesia. Evaluation of Edward Clapham Counting his negative symptoms (lack of speech and affect) and his grossly abnormal motor behavior, Edward fulfilled the criterion A requirements for schizophrenia. His illness had lasted far longer than the minimum 6 months (schizophrenia criterion C); it is hard to imagine how it could have had a greater effect on every aspect of his life (B). Nonetheless, on admission to the mental health unit, he was given a diagnosis of unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. This provisional diagnosis was given because the clinician could not be sure from the initial presenta - tion whether the symptoms were due to the effects of his dehydration and loss of weight (another medical condition), schizophrenia, or another cause such as a mood disorder, which is perhaps the most frequent cause of catatonic symptoms. The list of medical conditions that can produce catatonic behavior includes liver disease, strokes, epilepsy, and uncommon",
    "due to the effects of his dehydration and loss of weight (another medical condition), schizophrenia, or another cause such as a mood disorder, which is perhaps the most frequent cause of catatonic symptoms. The list of medical conditions that can produce catatonic behavior includes liver disease, strokes, epilepsy, and uncommon disorders such as Wilson\u2019s disease (a defect of copper metabolism) and the inherited disorder (autosomal dominant), tuberous scle- rosis. These possibilities should be vigorously pursued with neurological and medical consultation and with the appropriate laboratory and X-ray studies. Urine or blood screens for toxic substances or drugs of abuse should be considered a part of every such patient\u2019s workup. Any patient who presents with a first episode of catatonia should prob- ably have an MRI. When Edward Clapham was diagnosed, there was no MRI; we\u2019ll have to take criterion E on faith. Many patients who have been diagnosed as having schizophrenia, catatonic type, really have a manic phase of bipolar I disorder (D). On the other hand, a patient with severe psychomotor slowing should be considered for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with melancholic features. Although patients with somatic symptom disor - der are occasionally mute or have abnormal motor activity, such episodes are usually Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 103 short-lived, lasting only a few hours or days, not years. Edward had been ill for years; a chronic, psychotic, catatonic mood disorder seems unlikely. Edward\u2019s symptoms were classic for catatonia associated with schizophrenia. He demonstrated grimacing (catatonia specifier criterion A10), muteness (A4), waxy flex - ibility (A3), and catalepsy (A2). He could not be called stuporous because he was alert enough to turn away from an approaching stimulus (negativism\u2014A5). His behavior range was insufficient to demonstrate other typical catatonic behaviors. Because he had already been extensively (and unsuccessfully) treated with neu - roleptics, Edward was given a course of electroconvulsive therapy. Although the first three bilateral treatments produced no noticeable effect, after the fourth he asked for a glass of water. After a total of 10 treatments, he was conversing with others on the ward, feeding himself, and walking\u2014always on tiptoe because of the severe contractures at his ankles. Although he continued to show residual symptoms of his disease, his cata - tonic symptoms disappeared. He eventually left the hospital, whereupon he was lost to follow-up.

After appropriate med- ical investigations and additional history ruled out other possible causes of his abnormal behavior, his revised diagnosis was as given below. By the way, without reference to the official DSM-5 severity criteria for psychosis (p. 74), on admission I\u2019d give Edward a rating of severe . I anticipate no backlash from outraged coding mavens, though I still feel that the overall global evaluation of the GAF does a better job.

Marion Wright Since graduating from high school 12 years earlier, Marion Wright had worked as a sign painter. In school he had shown some aptitude for art, though not enough that he saw himself as the next Pablo Picasso. Nor did he like school enough to study for a career in commercial art. But painting signs on buildings and billboards was undemanding, well- paying, immediately available, and largely open-air. Within a few years he was married, had two kids and a small house in a subdivision, and was still painting signs. He thought he was set for life. One afternoon not long after his 30th birthday, his foreman drove by to inspect the billboard Marion had just finished. \u201cYou\u2019ve painted the logo in script.",
    "was married, had two kids and a small house in a subdivision, and was still painting signs. He thought he was set for life. One afternoon not long after his 30th birthday, his foreman drove by to inspect the billboard Marion had just finished. \u201cYou\u2019ve painted the logo in script. The blueprint calls for block letters,\u201d the foreman pointed out. Marion said that he thought the script looked better, but without much grumbling he changed it. A week later he completed an ad for a local premium beer; the female model holding the bottle was naked from the waist up. The following day he was out of work. Marion made a few efforts to find a new job, but within a week he was staying at home and watching daytime TV. His wife noted that he seemed to be talking less and less, but he ignored her suggestion to seek clinical evaluation. Although he continued to eat and sleep normally, his interest in sex had vanished. By the fourth week after losing his job, he had no spontaneous speech at all and would only answer a question if it was directly put to him. With the added persuasion of Marion\u2019s brother, his wife finally got him to the clinic. He was immediately hospitalized. On admission Marion would answer questions appropriately, if briefly. Fully ori - ented, he denied feeling depressed or suicidal. He had no delusions, hallucinations, obsessions or compulsions. He earned a perfect score on the MMSE, though the exam- iner noted that he was slow to carry out instructions. The following morning he deliberately turned away from the nurse who approached his bedside. Although he willingly accompanied the nurse to a table in the dining room, he refused to eat and was completely mute. In fact, the clinician who examined him later that morning found that Marion would readily move in any direction at the slight- est touch of an examiner\u2019s hand. In the evening he seemed improved and even spoke a few words. But the next day, he lay on his back in bed, again silently refusing to cooperate. When his pillow was removed, his head remained elevated about two inches above the mattress. This position appeared to cause him no discomfort; he seemed willing to maintain it all day.

This position appeared to cause him no discomfort; he seemed willing to maintain it all day. Later, an examiner noted that when Marion\u2019s arm was twisted into an awkward position (elevated at an angle over the bed), he maintained that position even when he was told that he could relax. Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 105 Marion\u2019s clinicians considered the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but they noted that he had been only briefly ill and had no family history of psychosis. His wife assured them that he had never abused drugs or alcohol. Despite the fact that his neurological exam remained normal, an MRI of his head was obtained. It revealed a tumor the size of a golf ball sitting on the convexity of his right frontal lobe. Once this was surgically removed, he quickly regained full consciousness. Two months later he was back on his ladder painting billboards, following instructions to the letter. Evaluation of Marion Wright Marion had several symptoms (three are required) that are classical for catatonia (cri - terion A). His included negativism and muteness (A5, A4), exaggerated compliance (though this is not one of the criteria DSM-5 mentions), a \u201cpsychological pillow\u201d (a form of posturing in which he held his head unsupported above the mattress\u2014A6), and catalepsy (A2). Marion did not have the wandering attention found in delirium (D). Catatonic behavior can be found in schizophrenia, which his clinicians correctly rejected because he had been ill too briefly (C). Too few symptoms (and better choices) ruled out schizo- phreniform disorder. Muteness and marked motor slowing, even to the point of immo- bility, can be encountered in major depressive episode, but Marion specifically denied mood symptoms. Muteness may occasionally be encountered in somatic symptom dis- order and in malingering and factitious disorder, but it would be unusual to encounter a full, persisting catatonic syndrome in one of these conditions. Note that catatonic behavior can include excessive or even frenzied motor activity. Then the differential diagnosis would include manic episode and substance use intoxi- cation. Of course, neither of these applies to Marion\u2019s case. On laboratory examination of the surgical specimen, Marion was found to have a (benign) brain tumor, which can directly result in catatonic symptoms (B) and which caused manifest impairment (E).

In this disorder (not specifically mentioned in DSM-5, but first described in 1790!), elderly people report complex visual hallucinations (scenes, people) but no other hallucinations or delusions. They also have insight that what they \u201csee\u201d is unreal. As such, they aren\u2019t truly psychotic, but one can argue that the condition belongs somewhere along the spectrum of psychotic dis - orders. Attenuated psychosis syndrome. A patient has psychotic symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for any psychotic disorder (less disabling symptoms, relatively good insight, etc.). Persistent auditory hallucinations. The patient experiences repeated auditory hallucinations without other symptoms. Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional disorder.

Quick Guide to the Mood Disorders DSM-5 uses three groups of criteria sets to diagnose mental problems related to mood: (1) mood episodes, (2) mood disorders, and (3) specifiers describing most recent episode and recurrent course.

Mood Episodes Simply expressed, a mood episode refers to any period of time when a patient feels abnor- mally happy or sad. Mood episodes are the building blocks from which many of the codable mood disorders are constructed. Most patients with mood disorders (though not the major- ity of mood disorder types) will have one or more of these three episodes: major depressive, manic, and hypomanic. Without additional information, none of these mood episodes is a codable diagnosis. Major depressive episode. For at least 2 weeks, the patient feels depressed (or cannot enjoy life) and has problems with eating and sleeping, guilt feelings, low energy, trouble concen- trating, and thoughts about death (p. 112). Manic episode. For at least 1 week, the patient feels elated (or sometimes only irritable) and may be grandiose, talkative, hyperactive, and distractible. Bad judgment leads to marked social or work impairment; often patients must be hospitalized (p. 116). Hypomanic episode. This is much like a manic episode, but it is briefer and less severe. Hos- pitalization is not required (p. 120). Mood Disorders A mood disorder is a pattern of illness due to an abnormal mood. Nearly every patient who has a mood disorder experiences depression at some time, but some also have highs of mood. Many, but not all, mood disorders are diagnosed on the basis of a mood episode. Most patients with mood disorders will fit into one of the codable categories listed below.",
    "Nearly every patient who has a mood disorder experiences depression at some time, but some also have highs of mood. Many, but not all, mood disorders are diagnosed on the basis of a mood episode. Most patients with mood disorders will fit into one of the codable categories listed below. DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS Major depressive disorder. These patients have had no manic or hypomanic episodes, but have had one or more major depressive episodes. Major depressive disorder will be either recurrent or single episode (p. 122). Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). There are no high phases, and it lasts much longer than typical major depressive disorder. This type of depression is not usually severe enough to be called an episode of major depression (though chronic major depression is now included here). (p. 138). Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A child\u2019s mood is persistently negative between frequent, severe explosions of temper (p. 149). Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A few days before her menses, a woman experiences symptoms of depression and anxiety (p. 146). Depressive disorder due to another medical condition. A variety of medical and neurologi- cal conditions can produce depressive symptoms; these need not meet criteria for any of the conditions above (p. 153). Substance/medication- induced depressive disorder. Alcohol or other substances (intoxica - tion or withdrawal) can cause depressive symptoms; these need not meet criteria for any of the conditions above (p. 151). Other specified, or unspecified, depressive disorder. Use one of these categories when a patient has depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for the depressive diagnoses above or for any other diagnosis in which depression is a feature (pp. 169, 170). BIPOLAR AND RELATED DISORDERS Approximately 25% of patients with mood disorders experience manic or hypomanic epi - sodes. Nearly all of these patients will also have episodes of depression. The severity and duration of the highs and lows determine the specific bipolar disorder. Bipolar I disorder. There must be at least one manic episode; most patients with bipolar I have also had a major depressive episode (p. 129). Bipolar II disorder. This diagnosis requires at least one hypomanic episode plus at least one major depressive episode (p. 135). Quick Guide to the Mood Disorders 109 Cyclothymic disorder. These patients have had repeated mood swings, but none that are severe enough to be called major depressive episodes or manic episodes (p. 143). Substance/medication- induced bipolar disorder.

These patients have had repeated mood swings, but none that are severe enough to be called major depressive episodes or manic episodes (p. 143). Substance/medication- induced bipolar disorder. Alcohol or other substances (intoxication or withdrawal) can cause manic or hypomanic symptoms; these need not meet criteria for any of the conditions above (p. 151). Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. A variety of medical and neurological conditions can produce manic or hypomanic symptoms; these need not meet criteria for any of the conditions above (p. 153). Other specified, or unspecified, bipolar disorder. Use one of these categories when a patient has bipolar symptoms that do not meet the criteria for the bipolar diagnoses above (pp. 167, 169). Other Causes of Depressive and Manic Symptoms Schizoaffective disorder. In these patients, symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia coexist with a major depressive or a manic episode (p. 88). Major and mild neurocognitive disorders with behavioral disturbance. The qualifier with behavioral disturbance can be coded into the diagnosis of major or mild neurocognitive dis- order (p. 492). OK, so mood symptoms don\u2019t sound all that behavioral, but that\u2019s how DSM-5 elects to indicate the cognitive disorders with depression. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood. This term codes one way of adapting to a life stress (p. 228). Personality disorders. Dysphoric mood is specifically mentioned in the criteria for borderline personality disorder (p. 545), but depressed mood commonly accompanies avoidant, depen- dent, and histrionic personality disorders. Uncomplicated bereavement. Sadness at the death of a relative or friend is a common expe- rience. Because uncomplicated bereavement is a normal reaction to a particular type of stressor, it is recorded not as a disorder, but as a Z-code [V-code]. See page 590. Other disorders. Depression can accompany many other mental disorders, including schizo- phrenia, the eating disorders, somatic symptom disorder, sexual dysfunctions, and gender dysphorias. Mood symptoms are likely in patients with an anxiety disorder (especially panic disorder and the phobic disorders), obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Specifiers Two special sets of descriptions can be applied to a number of the mood episodes and mood disorders. 110 MOOD DISOrDErS SPECIFIERS DESCRIBING CURRENT OR MOST RECENT EPISODE These descriptors help characterize the most recent major depressive episode; all but the first two can also apply to a manic",
    "Specifiers Two special sets of descriptions can be applied to a number of the mood episodes and mood disorders. 110 MOOD DISOrDErS SPECIFIERS DESCRIBING CURRENT OR MOST RECENT EPISODE These descriptors help characterize the most recent major depressive episode; all but the first two can also apply to a manic episode. (Note that the specifiers for severity and remis- sion are described on p. 158.) With atypical features. These depressed patients eat a lot and gain weight, sleep excessively, and have a feeling of being sluggish or paralyzed. They are often excessively sensitive to rejection (p. 160). With melancholic features. This term applies to major depressive episodes characterized by some of the \u201cclassic\u201d symptoms of severe depression. These patients awaken early, feeling worse than they do later in the day. They lose appetite and weight, feel guilty, are either slowed down or agitated, and do not feel better when something happens that they would normally like (p. 161). With anxious distress. A patient has symptoms of anxiety, tension, restlessness, worry, or fear that accompanies a mood episode (p. 159). With catatonic features. There are features of either motor hyperactivity or inactivity. Cata- tonic features can apply to major depressive episodes and to manic episodes (p. 100). With mixed features. Manic, hypomanic, and major depressive episodes may have mixtures of manic and depressive symptoms (p. 161). With peripartum onset. A manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode (or a brief psy - chotic disorder) can occur in a woman during pregnancy or within a month of having a baby (p. 163). With psychotic features. Manic and major depressive episodes can be accompanied by delu- sions, which can be mood- congruent or -incongruent (p. 164). SPECIFIERS DESCRIBING COURSE OF RECURRING EPISODES These specifiers describe the overall course of a mood disorder, not just the form of an indi- vidual episode. With rapid cycling. Within 1 year, the patient has had at least four episodes (in any combina- tion) fulfilling criteria for major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episodes (p. 165). With seasonal pattern. These patients regularly become ill at a certain time of the year, such as fall or winter (p. 165).

Recognizing when mood is disordered is extremely important, because as many as 20% of adult women and 10% of adult men may have the experience at some time during their lives. The prevalence of mood disorders seems to be increasing in both sexes, accounting for half or more of a mental health practice. Mood disorders can occur in people of any race or socioeconomic status, but they are more common among those who are single and who have no \u201csignificant other.\u201d A mood disorder is also more likely in someone who has relatives with similar problems. The mood disorders encompass many diagnoses, qualifiers, and levels of severity. Although they may seem complicated, they can be reduced to a few main principles. years ago, the mood disorders were called affective disorders; many clinicians still use the older term, which is also entrenched in the name seasonal affective disorder. note, by the way, that the term affect covers more than just a patient\u2019s statement of emotion. It also encompasses how the patient appears to be feeling, as shown by physical clues such as facial expression, posture, eye contact, and tearfulness. Emphasis on the actual mood experience of the patient, rather than the sometimes fuzzy concept of affect , dictates the current use of mood. In this section, I\u2019ll describe three types of mood episodes. You will find case vignettes illustrating each one in the sections on the mood disorders themselves, which follow. Major Depressive Episode Major depressive episode is one of the building blocks of the mood disorders, but it\u2019s not a codable diagnosis. you will use it often\u2014it is one of the most common problems for which patients seek help. a pply it carefully after considering a patient\u2019s full history and mental status exam. (Of course, we should be careful in using every label and every diagnosis.) I mention this caution here because some clinicians tend to use the major depressive epi- sode label almost as a reflex, without really considering the evidence. Once it gets applied, too often there is a reflexive reaching for the prescription pad. A major depressive episode must meet five major requirements.

    "major depressive epi- sode label almost as a reflex, without really considering the evidence. Once it gets applied, too often there is a reflexive reaching for the prescription pad. A major depressive episode must meet five major requirements. There must be (1) a quality of depressed mood (or loss of interest or pleasure) that (2) has existed for a 112 MOOD DISOrDErS minimum period of time, (3) is accompanied by a required number of symptoms, (4) has resulted in distress or disability, and (5) violates none of the listed exclusions. Quality of Mood Depression is usually experienced as a mood lower than normal; patients may describe it as feeling \u201cunhappy,\u201d \u201cdownhearted,\u201d \u201cbummed,\u201d \u201cblue,\u201d or many other terms expressing sadness. Several issues can interfere with the recognition of depression: \u2022\u2022 Not all patients can recognize or accurately describe how they feel. \u2022\u2022 Clinicians and patients who come from different cultural backgrounds may have difficulty agreeing that the problem is depression. \u2022\u2022 The presenting symptoms of depression can vary greatly from one patient to another. One patient may be slowed down and crying; another will smile and deny that anything is wrong. Some sleep and eat too much; others complain of insomnia and anorexia. \u2022\u2022 Some patients don\u2019t really feel depressed; rather, they experience depression as a loss of pleasure or reduced interest in their usual activities, including sex. \u2022\u2022 Crucial to diagnosis is that the episode must represent a noticeable change from the patient\u2019s usual level of functioning. If the patient does not notice it (some are too ill to pay attention or too apathetic to care), family or friends may report that there has been such a change. Duration The patient must have felt bad most of the day, almost every day, for at least 2 weeks. This requirement is included to ensure that major depressive episodes are differenti - ated from the transient \u201cdown\u201d spells that most of us sometimes feel. Symptoms During the 2 weeks just mentioned, the patient must have at least five of the italicized symptoms below. Those five must include either depressed mood or loss of pleasure, and the symptoms must overall indicate that the person is performing at a lower level than before. Depressed mood is self- explanatory; loss of pleasure is nearly universal among depressed patients. These symptoms can be counted either if the patient reports them or if others observe that they",
    "of pleasure, and the symptoms must overall indicate that the person is performing at a lower level than before. Depressed mood is self- explanatory; loss of pleasure is nearly universal among depressed patients. These symptoms can be counted either if the patient reports them or if others observe that they occur. Many patients lose appetite and weight . More than three- fourths report trouble with sleep. Typically, they awaken early in the morning, long before it is time to arise. However, some patients eat and sleep more than usual; most of these patients will qualify for the atypical features specifier (p. 160). Major Depressive Episode 113 Depressed patients will usually complain of fatigue , which they may express as tiredness or low energy. Their speech or physical movements may be slowed; some - times there is a marked pause before answering a question or initiating an action. This is called psychomotor retardation . Speech may be very quiet, sometimes inaudible. Some patients simply stop talking completely, except in response to a direct question. At the extreme, complete muteness may occur. At the other extreme, some depressed patients feel so anxious that they become agitated. Agitation may be expressed as hand wringing, pacing, or an inability to sit still. The ability of depressed patients to evaluate themselves objectively plummets; this shows up as low self- esteem or guilt. Some patients develop trouble with concentration (real or perceived) so severe that sometimes a misdiagnosis of dementia may be made. Thoughts of death, death wishes , and suicidal ideas are the most serious depressive symptoms of all, because there is a real risk that the patient will successfully act upon them. To count as a DSM-5 symptom for major depressive episode, the behaviors listed above must occur nearly every day. However, thoughts about death or suicide need only be \u201crecurrent.\u201d A single suicide attempt or a specific suicide plan will also qualify. In general, the more closely a patient resembles this outline, the more reliable will be the diagnosis of major depressive episode. We should note, however, that depressed patients can have many symptoms besides those listed in the DSM-5 criteria. They can include crying spells, phobias, obsessions, and compulsions. Patients may admit to feeling hopeless, helpless, or worthless. Anxiety symptoms, especially panic attacks (see p. 173), can be so prominent that they blind clinicians to the underlying depression. Many patients drink more",
    "symptoms besides those listed in the DSM-5 criteria. They can include crying spells, phobias, obsessions, and compulsions. Patients may admit to feeling hopeless, helpless, or worthless. Anxiety symptoms, especially panic attacks (see p. 173), can be so prominent that they blind clinicians to the underlying depression. Many patients drink more (occasionally, less) alcohol when they become depressed. This can lead to difficulty in sorting out the differential diagnosis: Which should be treated first, the depression or the drinking? (Hint: Usually, both at once.) A small minority of patients lose contact with reality and develop delusions or hallucinations. These psychotic features can be either mood- congruent (for example, a depressed man feels so guilty that he imagines he has committed some awful sin) or mood- incongruent (a depressed person who imagines persecution by the FBI is not experiencing a typical theme of depression). Psychotic symptoms are indicated in the severity indicator (it\u2019s verbiage you add to the diagnosis, and the final number in either the ICD-9 or ICD-10 code, as discussed later in this chapter). The case vignette of Brian Murphy (p. 124) includes an example. There are three situations in which you should not count a symptom toward a diagnosis of major depressive episode: 1. a symptom is fully explained by another medical condition. For example, you wouldn\u2019t count fatigue in a patient who is recovering from major surgery; in that situation, you expect fatigue. 2. a symptom results from mood- incongruent delusions or hallucinations. For 114 MOOD DISOrDErS example, don\u2019t count insomnia that is a response to hallucinated voices that keep the patient awake throughout the night. 3. Feelings of guilt or worthlessness that occur because the patient is too depressed to fulfill responsibilities. Such feelings are too common in depres - sion to carry any diagnostic weight. Rather, look for guilt feelings that are way outside the boundaries of what\u2019s reasonable. a n extreme example: a woman believes that her wickedness caused the tragedies of 9/11. Impairment The episode must be serious enough to cause material distress or to impair the patient\u2019s work (or school) performance, social life (withdrawal or discord), or some other area of functioning, including sex. Of the various consequences of mental illness, the effect on work may the hardest to detect.

    "(withdrawal or discord), or some other area of functioning, including sex. Of the various consequences of mental illness, the effect on work may the hardest to detect. Perhaps this is because earning a livelihood is so important that most people will go to great lengths to hide symptoms that could threaten their employment. Exclusions Regardless of the severity or duration of symptoms, major depressive episode usually should not be diagnosed in the face of clinically important substance use or a general medical disorder that could cause the symptoms. Essential Features of Major Depressive Episode These people are miserable. Most feel sad, down, depressed, or some equivalent; however, some few will instead insist that they\u2019ve only lost interest in nearly all their once-loved activities. All will admit to varying numbers of other symptoms\u2014such as fatigue, inability to concentrate, feeling worthless or guilty, and wishes for death or thoughts of suicide. In addition, three symptom areas may show either an increase or a decrease from normal: sleep, appetite/weight, and psychomotor activity. (For each of these, the classic picture is a decrease from normal\u2014in appetite, for example\u2014but some \u201catypical\u201d patients will report an increase.) The Fine Print Also, children or adolescents may only feel or seem irritable, not depressed. Don\u2019t disregard the D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (most of nearly every day, 2+ weeks) \u2022 Distress or disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders) Major Depressive Episode 115 Coding Notes No code alert: Major depressive episode is not a diagnosable illness; it is a building block of major depressive, bipolar I, and bipolar II disorders. It may also be found in persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). However, certain specifier codes apply to major depressive episodes\u2014though you tack them on only after you\u2019ve decided on the actual mood disorder diagnosis. Relax; this will all become clear as we proceed. The bereavement exclusion that was used through DSM-IV is not to be found in DSM-5, because recent research has determined that depressions closely preceded by the death or loss of a loved one do not differ substantially from depressions preceded by other stressors (or possibly by none at all). There\u2019s been a lot of breast beating over this move, or rather removal. Some claim that it places patients at risk for diagnosis of a mood disorder when context renders symptoms understandable; a substantial expansion in the number of people we regard",
    "other stressors (or possibly by none at all). There\u2019s been a lot of breast beating over this move, or rather removal. Some claim that it places patients at risk for diagnosis of a mood disorder when context renders symptoms understandable; a substantial expansion in the number of people we regard as mentally ill could result. I see the situation a little differently: We clinicians now have one fewer artificial bar - riers to diagnosis and treatment. However, as with any other freedom, we must use it responsibly. Evaluate the whole situation, especially the severity of symptoms, any previ- ous history of mood disorder, the timing and severity of putative precipitant (bereavement plus other forms of loss), and the trajectory of the syndrome (is it getting worse or better?). and reevaluate frequently. I\u2019ve included examples of major depressive episode in the following vignettes: b rian Murphy (p. 124), Elizabeth Jacks (p. 131), Winona Fisk (p. 133), Iris McMaster (p. 136), noah Sanders (p. 141), Sal c amozzi (p. 304), and a ileen Parmeter (p. 127). In addition, there may be some examples in chapter 20, \u201cPatients and Diagnoses\u201d\u2014but you\u2019ll have to find them for yourself. Manic Episode The second \u201cbuilding block\u201d of the mood disorders, manic episode, has been recog - nized for at least 150 years. The classic triad of manic symptoms consists of height - ened self- esteem, increased motor activity, and pressured speech. These symptoms are obvious and often outrageous, so manic episode is not often overdiagnosed. However, the psychotic symptoms that sometimes attend manic episode can be so florid that clinicians instead diagnose schizophrenia. This tendency to misdiagnosis may have decreased since 1980, when the DSM-III criteria increased clinicians\u2019 awareness of bipolar illness. The introduction of lithium treatment for bipolar disorders in 1970 also helped promote the diagnosis. Manic episode is much less common than major depressive episode, perhaps affecting 1% of all adults. Men and women are about equally likely to have mania. 116 MOOD DISOrDErS The features that must be present in order to diagnose manic episode are identi - cal to those for major depressive episode: (1) A mood quality that (2) has existed for a required period of time, (3) is attended by a required number of symptoms, (4) has resulted in a considerable degree of disability, and (5) violates none of the listed exclu- sions. Quality of Mood Some patients with relatively",
    "depressive episode: (1) A mood quality that (2) has existed for a required period of time, (3) is attended by a required number of symptoms, (4) has resulted in a considerable degree of disability, and (5) violates none of the listed exclu- sions. Quality of Mood Some patients with relatively mild symptoms just feel jolly; this bumptious good humor can be quite infectious and may make others feel like laughing with them. But as mania worsens, this humor becomes less cheerful as it takes on a \u201cdriven,\u201d unfunny quality that creates discomfort in patients and listeners alike. A few patients will have mood that is only irritable; euphoria and irritability sometimes occur together. Duration The patient must have had symptoms for a minimum of 1 week. This time requirement helps to differentiate manic episode from hypomanic episode. Symptoms In addition to the change in mood (euphoria or irritability), the patient must also have an increase in energy or activity level during a 1-week period. With these changes, at least three of the italicized symptoms listed below must also be present to an important degree during the same time period. (Note that if the patient\u2019s abnormal mood is only irritable\u2014that is, without any component of euphoria\u2014four symptoms are required in addition to the increased activity level.) Heightened self- esteem, found in most patients, can become grandiose to the point that it is delusional. Then patients believe that they can advise presidents and solve the problem of world hunger, in addition to more mundane tasks such as conducting psy - chotherapy and running the very medical facilities that currently house them. Because such delusions are in keeping with the euphoric mood, they are called mood- congruent. Manic patients typically report feeling rested on little sleep . Time spent sleep - ing seems wasted; they prefer to pursue their many projects. In its milder forms, this heightened activity may be goal- directed and useful; patients who are only moderately ill can accomplish quite a lot in a 20-hour day. But as they become more and more active, agitation ensues, and they may begin many projects they never complete. At this point they have lost judgment for what is reasonable and attainable. They may become involved in risky business ventures, indiscreet sexual liaisons, and questionable reli - gious or political activities. Manic patients are eager to tell anyone who will listen about their ideas,",
    "many projects they never complete. At this point they have lost judgment for what is reasonable and attainable. They may become involved in risky business ventures, indiscreet sexual liaisons, and questionable reli - gious or political activities. Manic patients are eager to tell anyone who will listen about their ideas, plans, and work, and they do so in speech that is loud and difficult to interrupt. Manic speech Manic Episode 117 is often rapid and pressured , as if there were too many dammed-up words trying to escape through a tiny nozzle. The resulting speech may exhibit what is called flight of ideas, in which one thought triggers another to which it bears only a marginally logical association. As a result, a patient may wander far afield from where the conversation (or monologue) started. Manic patients may also be easily distracted by irrelevant sounds or movements that other people would ignore. Some manic patients retain insight and seek treatment, but many will deny that anything is wrong. They rationalize that no one who feels this well or is so productive could possibly be ill. Manic behavior therefore continues until it ends spontaneously or the patient is hospitalized or jailed. I consider manic episodes to be acute emergencies, and I don\u2019t expect many clinicians will argue. Some symptoms not specifically mentioned in the DSM-5 criteria are also worth noting here. 1. Even during an acute manic episode, many patients have brief periods of depression. These \u201cmicrodepressions\u201d are relatively common; depending on the symptoms associated with them, they may suggest that the specifier with mixed features is appropriate (p. 161). 2. Patients may use substances (especially alcohol) in an attempt to relieve the uncomfortable, driven feeling that accompanies a severe manic episode. Less often, the substance use temporarily obscures the symptoms of the mood epi - sode. When clinicians become confused about whether the substance use or the mania came first, the question can usually be sorted out with the help of informants. 3. Catatonic symptoms occasionally occur during a manic episode, sometimes causing the episode to resemble schizophrenia. But a history (obtained from informants) of acute onset and previous episodes with recovery can help clar - ify the diagnosis. Then the specifier with catatonic features may be indicated (p. 100). What about episodes that don\u2019t start until the patient undergoes treatment for a depres - sion? Should they count as fully",
    "(obtained from informants) of acute onset and previous episodes with recovery can help clar - ify the diagnosis. Then the specifier with catatonic features may be indicated (p. 100). What about episodes that don\u2019t start until the patient undergoes treatment for a depres - sion? Should they count as fully as evidence of spontaneous mania or hypomania? To count as evidence for either manic or hypomanic episode, DSM-5 requires that the full criteria (not just a couple of symptoms, such as agitation or irritability) be present, and that the symptoms last longer than the expected physiological effects of the treatment. This declaration nicely rounds out the list of possibilities: DSM-IV stated flatly that manic episodes caused by treatment could not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, whereas DSM-III-R implied that they could. a nd DSM-III kept silent on the whole matter. The authors of the successive DSMs may have been thinking of Emerson\u2019s famous epigram: a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. 118 MOOD DISOrDErS Impairment Manic episodes typically wreak havoc on the lives of patients and their associates. Although increasing energy and effort may at first actually improve productivity at work (or school), as mania worsens a patient becomes less and less able to focus atten - tion. Friendships are strained by arguments. Sexual entanglements can result in dis - ease, divorce, and unwanted pregnancy. Even when the episode has resolved, guilt and recriminations remain behind. Exclusions The exclusions for manic episode are the same as for major depressive episode. Gen - eral medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism can produce hyperactive behavior; patients who misuse certain psychoactive substances (especially amphetamines) will appear speeded up and may report feeling strong, powerful, and euphoric. Essential Features of Manic Episode Patients in the throes of mania are almost unmistakable. These people feel euphoric (though sometimes they\u2019re only irritable), and there\u2019s no way you can ignore their energy and frenetic activity. They are full of plans, few of which they carry through (they are so distractible). They talk and laugh, and talk some more, often very fast, often with flight of ideas. They sleep less than usual (\u201ca waste of time, when there\u2019s so much to do\u201d), but feel great anyway. Grandiosity is sometimes so exaggerated that they become psychotic, believing that they are exalted personages (monarchs, rock stars) or that they have superhuman powers. With deteriorating judgment (they",

Grandiosity is sometimes so exaggerated that they become psychotic, believing that they are exalted personages (monarchs, rock stars) or that they have superhuman powers. With deteriorating judgment (they spend money unwisely, engage in ill- conceived sexual adventures), functioning becomes impaired, often to the point they must be hospitalized to force treatment or for their own protection or that of other people. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (most of nearly every day, 1+ weeks) \u2022 Distress or disability (work/ educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders, schizoaffective disorder, neurocognitive disorders, hypomanic episodes, cyclothymia) Coding Notes Manic episode is not a diagnosable illness; it is a building block of bipolar I disorder. Manic Episode 119 Elisabeth Jacks had a manic episode; you can read her history beginning on page 131. Another example is that of Winona Fisk (p. 133). Look for other cases in the patient histories given in Chapter 20. Hypomanic Episode Hypomanic episode is the final mood disorder \u201cbuilding block.\u201d Comprising most of the same symptoms as manic episode, it is \u201cmanic episode writ small.\u201d Left without treatment, some patients with hypomanic episode may become manic later on. But many, especially those who have bipolar II disorder, have repeated hypomanic epi - sodes. Hypomanic episode isn\u2019t codable as a diagnosis; it forms the basis for bipolar II disorder, and it can be encountered in bipolar I disorder, after the patient has already experienced an episode of actual mania. Hypomanic episode requires (1) a mood qual- ity that (2) has existed for a required period of time, (3) is attended by a required num- ber of symptoms, (4) has resulted in a considerable degree of disability, and (5) violates none of the listed exclusions. Table 3.1 compares the features of manic and hypomanic episodes. Quality of Mood The quality of mood in hypomanic episode tends to be euphoric without the driven quality present in manic episode, though mood can instead be irritable. However described, it is clearly different from the patient\u2019s usual nondepressed mood. TABLE 3.1.

Symptoms As with manic episode, in addition to the change in mood (euphoria or irritability), the patient must also have an increase in energy or activity level\u2014but again, only for 4 days. Then at least three symptoms from the same list must be present to an impor - tant degree (and represent a noticeable change) during this 4 days. If the patient\u2019s abnormal mood is irritable and not elevated, four symptoms are required. Note that hypomanic episode precipitated by treatment can be adduced as evidence for, say, bipolar II disorder\u2014if it persists longer than the expected physiological effects of the treatment. The sleep of hypomanic patients may be brief, and activity level may be increased, sometimes to the point of agitation. Although the degree of agitation is less than in a manic episode, hypomanic patients can also feel driven and uncomfortable. Judg - ment deteriorates, and may lead to untoward consequences for finances or for work or social life. Speech may become rapid and pressured; racing thoughts or flight of ideas may be noticeable. Easily becoming distracted can be a feature of hypomanic episode. Heightened self- esteem is never so grandiose that it becomes delusional, and hypo - manic patients are never psychotic. In addition to the DSM-5 criteria, note that in hypomanic episode, as in manic episode, substance use is common. Impairment How severe",
    "becoming distracted can be a feature of hypomanic episode. Heightened self- esteem is never so grandiose that it becomes delusional, and hypo - manic patients are never psychotic. In addition to the DSM-5 criteria, note that in hypomanic episode, as in manic episode, substance use is common. Impairment How severe can the impairment be without qualifying as a manic episode? This is to some extent a judgment call for the practitioner. Lapses of judgment, such as spending sprees and sexual indiscretions, can occur in both manic and hypomanic episodes\u2014 but, by definition, only the patient who is truly manic will be seriously impaired. If behavior becomes so extreme that hospitalization is needed or psychosis is evident, the patient can no longer be considered hypomanic, and the label must be changed. Exclusions The exclusions are the same as those for manic episode. General medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism can produce hyperactive behavior; patients who misuse cer - tain substances (especially amphetamines) will appear speeded up and may also report feeling strong, powerful, and euphoric. Hypomanic Episode 121 Essential Features of Hypomanic Episode Hypomania is \u201cmania lite\u201d\u2014many of the same symptoms, but never to the same outrageous degree. These people feel euphoric or irritable and they experience high energy or activity. They are full of plans, which, despite some distractibility, they sometimes actually implement. They talk a lot, reflecting their racing thoughts, and may have flight of ideas. Judgment (sex and spending) may be impaired, but not to the point of requiring hospitalization for their own protection or that of oth - ers. Though the patients are sometimes grandiose and self- important, these features never reach the point of delusion. You would notice the change in such a person, but it doesn\u2019t impair functioning; indeed, sometimes these folks get quite a lot done!

Mood Disorders Based on the Mood Episodes From this point, the format of my presentation differs somewhat from both that of the DSM-5 and that of the Quick Guide at the beginning of the chapter. First, I\u2019ll discuss the mood disorders that use the mood episode \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d\u2014major depressive disorder and bipolar I and II disorders. Afterwards, I\u2019ll cover the disorders that do not crucially involve these episodes. Major Depressive Disorder A patient who has one or more major depressive episodes, and no manic or hypomanic symptoms, is said to have major depressive disorder (MDD). It is a common condition, affecting about 7% of the general population, with a female preponderance of roughly 2:1. MDD usually begins in the middle to late 20s, but it can occur at any time of life, from childhood to old age. The onset may be sudden or gradual. Although episodes 122 MOOD DISOrDErS last on average from 6 to 9 months, the range is enormous, from a few weeks to many years. Recovery usually begins within a few months of onset, though that too can vary enormously. A full recovery is less likely for a person who has a personality disorder or symptoms that are more severe (especially psychotic features). MDD is strongly heredi- tary; first- degree relatives have a risk several times that of the general population. Some patients have only a single episode during an entire lifetime; then they are diagnosed with (no surprise) MDD, single episode. However, roughly half the patients who have one major depressive episode will have another. At the point they develop a second episode (to count, it must be separated from the first by at least 2 months), we must change the diagnosis to MDD, recurrent type. For any given patient, symptoms of depression remain pretty much the same from one episode to the next. These patients will have an episode roughly every 4 years; there is some evidence that the frequency of episodes increases with age. Multiple epi- sodes of depression greatly increase the likelihood of suicide attempts and completed suicide. Unsurprisingly, patients with recurrent episodes are also much more likely than those with a single episode to be impaired by their symptoms.

Unsurprisingly, patients with recurrent episodes are also much more likely than those with a single episode to be impaired by their symptoms. One of the most severe consequences is suicide, which is the fate of about 4% of patients with MDD. Perhaps 25% of patients with MDD will eventually experience a manic or hypo - manic episode, thereby requiring yet another change in diagnosis\u2014this time to bipolar (I or II) disorder. We\u2019ll talk more about them later.

Major Depressive Disorder 123 Brian Murphy Brian Murphy had inherited a small business from his father and built it into a large one. When he sold out a few years later, he invested most of his money; with the rest, he bought a small almond farm in northern California. With his tractor, he handled most of the farm chores himself. Most years the farm earned a few hundred dollars, but as Brian was fond of pointing out, it really didn\u2019t make much difference. If he never made a dime, he felt he got \u201cfull value from keeping busy and fit.\u201d When Brian was 55, his mood, which had always been normal, slid into depres - sion. Farm chores seemed increasingly to be a burden; his tractor sat idle in its shed. As his mood blackened, Brian\u2019s body functioning seemed to deteriorate. Although he was constantly fatigued, often falling into bed by 9 p.m., he would invariably awaken at 2 or 3 a.m. Then obsessive worrying kept him awake until sunrise. Mornings were worst for him. The prospect of \u201canother damn day to get through\u201d seemed overwhelm- ing. In the evenings he usually felt somewhat better, though he\u2019d sit around working out sums on a magazine cover to",
    "at 2 or 3 a.m. Then obsessive worrying kept him awake until sunrise. Mornings were worst for him. The prospect of \u201canother damn day to get through\u201d seemed overwhelm- ing. In the evenings he usually felt somewhat better, though he\u2019d sit around working out sums on a magazine cover to see how much money they\u2019d have if he \u201ccouldn\u2019t work the farm\u201d and they had to live on their savings. His appetite deserted him. Although he never weighed himself, he had to buckle his belt two notches smaller than he had several months before. \u201cBrian just seemed to lose interest,\u201d his wife, Rachel, reported the day he was admitted to the hospital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t enjoy anything any more. He spends all his time sitting around and worrying about being in debt. We owe a few hundred dollars on our credit card, but we pay it off every month!\u201d During the previous week or two, Brian had begun to ruminate about his health. \u201cAt first it was his blood pressure,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cHe\u2019d ask me to take it several times a day. I still work part-time as a nurse. Several times he thought he was having a stroke. Then yesterday he became convinced that his heart was going to stop. He\u2019d get up, feel his pulse, pace around the room, lie down, put his feet above his head, do everything he could to \u2018keep it going.\u2019 That\u2019s when I decided to bring him here.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have to sell the farm.\u201d That was the first thing Brian said to the mental health clinician when they met. Brian was casually dressed and rather rumpled. He had promi- nent worry lines on his forehead, and he kept feeling for his pulse. Several times during the interview, he seemed unable to sit still; he would get up from the bed where he was sitting and pace over to the window. His speech was slow but coherent. He talked mostly about his feelings of being poverty- stricken and his fears that the farm would have to go on the block. He denied having hallucinations, but admitted to feeling tired and \u201call washed up\u2014 not good for anything any more.\u201d He was fully oriented, had a full fund of information, and scored a perfect 30 on the MMSE. He admitted that he was depressed, but he denied hav- ing thoughts about death. Somewhat reluctantly, he agreed that",

He admitted that he was depressed, but he denied hav- ing thoughts about death. Somewhat reluctantly, he agreed that he might need treatment. Rachel pointed out that with his generous disability policy, his investments, and his pension from his former company, they had more money coming in than when he was healthy. \u201cBut still we have to sell the farm,\u201d Brian replied. 124 MOOD DISOrDErS Evaluation of Brian Murphy Unfortunately, clinicians (including some mental health specialists) commonly make two sorts of mistakes when evaluating patients with depression. First, we sometimes focus too intently on a patient\u2019s anxiety, alcohol use, or psy - chotic symptoms and ignore underlying symptoms of depression or dysthymia. Here\u2019s my lifelong rule, formulated from bitter experience (not all mine) as far back as when I was a resident: always look for a mood disorder in any new patient, even if the chief complaint is something else. Second, the presenting depressive or manic symptoms can be quite noticeable, even dramatic\u2014to the point that clinicians may fail to notice, lurking underneath, the presence of alcohol use disorder or another disorder (good examples are neurocognitive and somatic symptom disorders). a nd that suggests another, equally important rule, almost the mirror image of the first rule: never assume that a mood disorder is your patient\u2019s only problem. First, let\u2019s try to identify the current (and any previous) mood episodes. Brian Murphy had been ill much longer than 2 weeks (criterion A). Of the major depressive episode symptoms listed (five are required by DSM-5), he had at least six: low mood (A1), loss of interest (A2), fatigue (A6), sleeplessness (A4), low self- esteem (A7), loss of appetite (A3), and agitation (A5). (Note that either low mood or loss of interest is required for diagno- sis; Brian had both.) He was so seriously impaired (B) that he required hospitalization. Although we do not have the results of his physical exam and laboratory testing, the vignette provides no history that would suggest another medical condition (for exam- ple, pancreatic carcinoma) or substance use (C). However, his clinician would definitely need to ask both Brian and his wife about this\u2014 depressed people often increase their drinking. He was clearly severely depressed and different",
    "laboratory testing, the vignette provides no history that would suggest another medical condition (for exam- ple, pancreatic carcinoma) or substance use (C). However, his clinician would definitely need to ask both Brian and his wife about this\u2014 depressed people often increase their drinking. He was clearly severely depressed and different from his usual self. He easily fulfilled the criteria for major depressive episode. Next, what type of mood disorder did Brian have? There had been no manic or hypomanic episodes (E), ruling out bipolar I or II disorder. His delusions of poverty could suggest a psychotic disorder (such as schizoaffective disorder), but he had too few psychotic symptoms, and the timing of mood symptoms versus delusions was wrong (D). He was deluded but had no additional A criteria for schizophrenia. His mood symptoms ruled out brief psychotic disorder and delusional disorder. He there- fore fulfilled the requirements for MDD. There are just two subtypes of MDD: single episode and recurrent. Although Brian Murphy might subsequently have other episodes of depression, this was the only one so far. For the further description and coding of Brian Murphy\u2019s depression, let\u2019s turn ahead to Table 3.2. His single episode dictates the column to highlight under MDD. And he was delusional, so we\u2019d code him as with psychotic features. But wait: Suppose he hadn\u2019t been psychotic? What severity would we assign him Major Depressive Disorder 125 then? Despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t suicidal (he didn\u2019t want death; rather, he feared it), he did have most of the required symptoms, and he was seriously impaired by his depressive illness. That\u2019s why I\u2019d rate him as severely depressed (but remember, the code number has already been determined). Now we\u2019ll turn to the panoply of other specifiers, which I\u2019ll discuss toward the end of this chapter (p. 159). Brian had no manic symptoms; that rules out with mixed features. His delusion that he was poor and would have to sell the farm was mood- congruent\u2014that is, in keeping with the usual cognitive themes of depression. (How - ever, the thought that his heart would stop and the pulse checking were probably not delusional. I\u2019d regard them as signifying the overwhelming anxiety he felt about the state of his health.) The words we\u2019d attach to his diagnosis (so far) would be MDD, single episode, severe with mood- congruent psychotic features. But wait; there\u2019s more. There were no",
    "the pulse checking were probably not delusional. I\u2019d regard them as signifying the overwhelming anxiety he felt about the state of his health.) The words we\u2019d attach to his diagnosis (so far) would be MDD, single episode, severe with mood- congruent psychotic features. But wait; there\u2019s more. There were no abnormalities of movement suggestive of catatonic features, nor did his depression have any atypical features (for example, he didn\u2019t have increased appetite or sleep too much). Of course, he would not qualify for peripartum onset. But his wife complained that he didn\u2019t \u201cenjoy anything any more,\u201d suggesting that he might qualify for melancholic features. He was agitated when inter- viewed (marked psychomotor slowing would have also qualified for this criterion), and he had lost considerable weight. He reported awakening early on many mornings (ter- minal insomnia). The interviewer did not ask him whether this episode of depression differed qualitatively from how he felt when his parents died, but I\u2019d bet that it did. So, we\u2019ll add with melancholic features to the mix. I wrote this vignette before a new specifier, with anxious distress , was a gleam in anyone\u2019s eye, but I think Brian Murphy qualifies for it as well. He appeared edgy and tense, and he was markedly restless. Furthermore, he seemed to be expressing the fear that something horrible\u2014 possibly a catastrophic health event\u2014would occur. Even though nothing was said about poor concentration, he had at least three of the symptoms required for the with anxious distress specifier, at a moderate severity rating. The evidence is that this specifier has real prognostic importance, suggesting, in the absence of treatment, the possibility of a poor outcome\u2014even suicide. Some patients with severe depression also report many of the symptoms typical of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or some other anxiety disorder. In such a case, two diagnoses could be made. Usually the mood disorder is listed first as the primary diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms that do not fulfill criteria for one of the disorders described in Chapter 4 may be further evaluated as evidence for the anxious distress specifier. Of course, Brian wouldn\u2019t qualify for rapid cycling or seasonal pattern; with only one episode, there could be no pattern. I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 51, and his final diagnosis would be as given below. Let me just say that the prospect of using so many different criteria sets to",
    "Brian wouldn\u2019t qualify for rapid cycling or seasonal pattern; with only one episode, there could be no pattern. I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 51, and his final diagnosis would be as given below. Let me just say that the prospect of using so many different criteria sets to code one patient may seem daunting, but taking it one step at a time reveals a process that is really quite logical and (once you get the hang of it) fairly quick. The same basic meth- ods should be applied to all examples of depression. (Of course, you could argue\u2014I 126 MOOD DISOrDErS certainly would\u2014that using the prototypical descriptions of depression and mania and their respective disorders simplifies things still further. But again, remember always to consider the possibility of substance use and physical causes of any given symptom set.) F32.3 [296.24] Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with mood- congruent psychotic features, with melancholic features, with moderate anxious distress There\u2019s a situation in which I like to be extra careful about diagnosing MDD. That\u2019s when a patient also has somatic symptom disorder (see p. 251). The problem is that many people who seem to have too many physical symptoms can also have mood symptoms that closely resemble major depressive episodes (and sometimes manic episodes). Over the years, I\u2019ve found that these people tend to get treatment with medication, electroconvulsive therapy (EcT), and other physical therapies that don\u2019t seem to help them much\u2014 certainly not for long. I\u2019m not saying that drugs never work; I maintain only that if you encounter a patient with somatic symptom disorder who is depressed, other treatments (such as cognitive- behavioral therapy or other forms of behavior modification) may be more effective and less fraught with complications. Aileen Parmeter \u201cI just know it was a terrible mistake to come here.\u201d For the third time, Aileen Parme- ter got out of her chair and walked to the window. A wiry 5 feet 2 inches, this former Marine master sergeant (she had supervised a steno pool) weighed a scant 100 pounds. Through the slats of the Venetian blinds, she peered longingly at freedom in the park - ing lot below. \u201cI just don\u2019t know whatever made me come.\u201d \u201cYou came because I asked you to,\u201d her clinician explained. \u201cYour nephew called and said you were getting depressed again.

It\u2019s just like last time.\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I was just upset,\u201d she explained patiently. \u201cI had a little cold for a few days and couldn\u2019t play my tennis. I\u2019ll be fine if I just get back to my little apart- ment.\u201d \u201cHave you been hearing voices or seeing things this time?\u201d \u201cWell, of course not.\u201d She seemed rather offended. \u201cYou might as well ask if I\u2019ve been drinking.\u201d After her last hospitalization, Aileen had been well for about 10 months. Although she had taken her medicine for only a few weeks, she had remained active until 3 weeks ago. Then she stopped seeing her friends and wouldn\u2019t play tennis because she \u201cjust didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d She worried constantly about her health and had been unable to sleep. Although she didn\u2019t complain of decreased appetite, she had lost about 10 pounds. \u201cWell, who wouldn\u2019t have trouble? I\u2019ve just been too tired to get my regular exer- cise.\u201d She tried to smile, but it came off crooked and forced. Major Depressive Disorder 127 \u201cMiss Parmeter, what about the suicidal thoughts?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d \u201cI mean, each time you\u2019ve been here\u2014last year, and 2 years before that\u2014you were admitted because you tried to kill yourself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine now. Just let me go home.\u201d But her therapist, whose memory was long, had ordered Aileen held for her own protection in a private room where she could be observed one-on-one. Sleepless still at 3 a.m., Aileen got up, smiled wanly at the attendant, and went in to use the bathroom. Looping a strip she had torn from her sweatsuit over the top of the door, she tried to hang herself. As the silence lengthened, the attendant called out softly, then tapped on the door, then opened it and sounded the alarm. The code team responded with no time to spare. The following morning, the therapist was back at her bedside. \u201cWhy did you try to do that, Miss Parmeter?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t try to do anything. I must have been confused.\u201d She gingerly touched the purple bruises that ringed her neck. \u201cThis sure hurts. I know",
    "with no time to spare. The following morning, the therapist was back at her bedside. \u201cWhy did you try to do that, Miss Parmeter?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t try to do anything. I must have been confused.\u201d She gingerly touched the purple bruises that ringed her neck. \u201cThis sure hurts. I know I\u2019d feel better if you\u2019d just let me go home.\u201d Aileen remained hospitalized for 10 days. Once her sore neck would allow, she began to take her antidepressant medication again. Soon she was sleeping and eating normally, and she made a perfect score on the MMSE. She was released to go home to her apartment and her tennis, still uncertain why everyone had made such a fuss about her. Evaluation of Aileen Parmeter Aileen never acknowledged feeling depressed, but she had lost interest in her usual activities. This change had lasted longer than 2 weeks, and\u2014as in previous episodes\u2014 her other symptoms included fatigue, insomnia, loss of weight, and suicidal behavior (criterion A). (Although she reproached herself for entering the hospital, these feelings referred exclusively to her being ill and would not be scored as guilt.) She was sick enough to require hospitalization, fulfilling the impairment criterion (B). Aileen could have a mood disorder due to another medical condition , and this would have to be pursued by her clinician, but the history of recurrence makes this seem unlikely (C). Symptoms of apathy and poor memory raise the question of mild neurocognitive disorder, but her MMSE showed no evidence of memory impairment. She denied alcohol consumption, so a substance- induced mood disorder would also appear unlikely (her clinician had known her for so long that further pursuit of the pos- sibility would be wasted effort). There was no evidence that Aileen had ever had mania or hypomania, ruling out bipolar I or II disorder (E), and absence of any psychotic symptoms rules out psy - chotic disorders (D). She therefore fulfills the criteria for MDD. She\u2019d had more than one episode separated by substantially longer than 2 months, which would satisfy the 128 MOOD DISOrDErS requirement for the term recurrent. Turning ahead to Table 3.2, we can reject the rows there describing psychotic features (she emphatically denied having delusions or hal - lucinations) and remission. Now we must consider the severity of her depression (p. 158). It is always a prob- lem how best to score someone with so little",
    "Turning ahead to Table 3.2, we can reject the rows there describing psychotic features (she emphatically denied having delusions or hal - lucinations) and remission. Now we must consider the severity of her depression (p. 158). It is always a prob- lem how best to score someone with so little insight. Even with the suicide attempt, Aileen appeared barely to meet the five symptoms needed for major depressive episode. According to the rules, she should receive a severity coding of no greater than moder - ate. However, for a patient who has just nearly killed herself, this would be inaccu - rate and possibly dangerous; one of her symptoms, suicidal behavior, was very serious indeed. As I\u2019ve said before, the coding instructions are meant to be guides, not shackles: I\u2019d call Aileen\u2019s depression severe. She wouldn\u2019t qualify for any of the specifiers for the most recent episode\u2014 perhaps because her lack of insight prevented her from providing full information. (I suppose that longer observation might reveal criteria adequate for with melancholic features.) Other diagnoses are sometimes found in patients with MDD. These include several of the anxiety disorders, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, and the substance- related disorders (especially alcohol use disorder). There is no evidence for any of these. I\u2019d give her a GAF score of only 15 on admission. Her GAF had improved to 60 by the time she was released. Her complete diagnosis would be as follows: F33.2 [296.33] Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe Bipolar I Disorder Bipolar I disorder is shorthand for any cyclic mood disorder that includes at least one manic episode. Although this nomenclature has only been adopted within the past sev- eral decades, bipolar I disorder has been recognized for over a century. Formerly, it was called manic\u2013 depressive illness; older clinicians may still refer to it this way. Men and women are about equally affected, for a total of approximately 1% of the general adult population. Bipolar I disorder is strongly hereditary. There are two technical points to consider in evaluating episodes of bipolar I disorder. First, for an episode to count as a new one, it must either represent a change of polarity (for example, from major depressive to manic or hypomanic episode), or it must be separated from the previous episode by a normal mood that lasts at least 2 months. Second, a manic or hypomanic episode will occasionally seem to be",
    "new one, it must either represent a change of polarity (for example, from major depressive to manic or hypomanic episode), or it must be separated from the previous episode by a normal mood that lasts at least 2 months. Second, a manic or hypomanic episode will occasionally seem to be precipitated by the treatment of a depression. Antidepressant drugs, ECT, or bright light (used to treat seasonal depression) may cause a patient to move rapidly from depression into a full-blown manic episode. Bipolar I disorder is defined by the occurrence of spontane- ous depressions, manias, and hypomanias; therefore, any treatment- induced manic or hypomanic episode can only be used to make the diagnosis of a bipolar I (or, for that Bipolar I Disorder 129 matter, bipolar II) condition if the symptoms persist beyond the physiological effect of that treatment. Even then, DSM-5 urges caution: Demand the full number of manic or hypomanic symptoms, not just edginess or agitation that some patients experience following treatment of depression. In addition, note the warning that the mood episodes must not be superimposed on a psychotic disorder\u2014 specifically schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delu - sional disorder, or unspecified psychotic disorder. Because the longitudinal course of bipolar I disorder differs strikingly from those of the psychotic disorders, this should only rarely cause diagnostic problems. Usually a manic episode will be current, and the patient will have been admit - ted to a hospital. Occasionally, you might use the category current or most recent epi - sode manic for a newly diagnosed patient who is on a mood- stabilizing regimen. Most will have had at least one previous manic, major depressive, or hypomanic episode. However, a single manic episode is hardly rare, especially early in the course of bipo - lar I disorder. Of course, the vast majority of such patients will later have subsequent major depressive episodes, as well as additional manic ones. Males are more likely than females to have a first episode that is manic.

    "used of the bipolar I subtypes; nearly all patients with this disorder will receive this diagnosis at some point during their lifetimes. The depressive symptoms will be very much like those in the major depres - sive disorders of Brian Murphy (p. 124) and Aileen Parmeter (p. 127). Elisabeth Jacks (p. 131), whose current episode was manic, had been depressed a few weeks before her current evaluation. In a given patient, symptoms of mood disorder tend to remain the same from one episode to the next. However, it is possible that after an earlier manic episode, a sub - sequent mood upswing may be less severe, and therefore only hypomanic. (The first episode of a bipolar I disorder couldn\u2019t be hypomanic; otherwise, you\u2019d have to diag - nose bipolar II.) Although I have provided no vignette for bipolar I, most recent epi - sode hypomanic, I have described a hypomanic episode in the case of Iris McMaster, a patient with bipolar II disorder (see p. 136). Researchers who have followed bipolar patients for many years report that some have only manias. The concept of unipolar mania has been debated off and on for a long time. There are probably some patients who will never have a depression, but most will, given enough time. I have known of patients who had as many as seven episodes of mania over a 20-year period before finally having a first episode of depression. What\u2019s important here is that all patients with bipolar I (and II) disorder\u2014and their families\u2014should be warned to watch out for depressive symptoms. b ipolar I patients have a high likelihood of completing suicide; some reports suggest that these people account for up to a quarter of all suicides. 130 MOOD DISOrDErS Essential Features of Bipolar I Disorder The patient has had at least one manic episode, plus any number (including zero) of hypomanic and major depressive episodes. The Fine Print A manic episode that was precipitated by treatment (medication, ECT, light therapy) can be counted toward a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder if the manic symptoms last beyond the expected physiological treatment effects.

Finally, choose from a whole lot of specifiers in Table 3.3. Older patients who develop a mania for the first time may have a comorbid neurological disorder. They may also have a higher mortality. First- episode mania in the elderly may be quite a different illness from recurrent mania in the elderly, and should probably be given a different diagnosis, such as unspecified bipolar disorder. Elisabeth Jacks Elisabeth Jacks ran a catering service with her second husband, Donald, who was the main informant. At age 38, Elisabeth already had two grown children, so Donald could understand why this pregnancy might have upset her. Even so, she had seemed unnaturally sad. From about her fourth month, she spent much of each day in bed, not arising until afternoon, when she began to feel a little less tired. Her appetite, voracious during her first trimester, fell off, so that by the time of delivery she was several pounds lighter than usual for a full-term pregnancy. She had to give up keeping the household and business accounts, because she couldn\u2019t focus her attention long enough to add a col - umn of figures. Still, the only time Donald became really alarmed was one evening at the beginning of Elisabeth\u2019s ninth month, when she told him that she had been think - ing for days that she wouldn\u2019t survive childbirth and he would have to rear the baby without her. \u201cYou\u2019ll both be better off without me, anyway,\u201d she had said. After their son was born, Elisabeth\u2019s mood brightened almost at once. The crying spells and the hours of rumination disappeared; briefly, she seemed almost her normal self. Late one Friday night, however, when the baby was 3 weeks old, Donald returned Bipolar I Disorder 131 from catering a banquet to find Elisabeth wearing only bra and panties and icing a cake. Two other just-iced cakes were lined up on the counter, and the kitchen was littered with dirty pots and pans. \u201cShe said she\u2019d made one for each of us, and she wanted to party,\u201d Donald told the clinician. \u201cI started to change the baby\u2014he was howling in his basket\u2014but she wanted to drag me off to the bedroom. She said",

She said \u2018Please, sweetie, it\u2019s been a long time.\u2019 I mean, even if I hadn\u2019t been dead tired, who could concentrate with the baby crying like that?\u201d All the next day, Elisabeth was out with girlfriends, leaving Donald home with the baby. On Sunday she spent nearly $300 for Christmas presents at an April garage sale. She seemed to have boundless energy, sleeping only 2 or 3 hours a night before arising, rested and ready to go. On Monday she decided to open a bakery; by telephone, she tried to charge over $1,600 worth of kitchen supplies to their Visa card. She\u2019d have done the same the next day, but she talked so fast that the person she called couldn\u2019t understand her. In frustration, she slammed the phone down. Elisabeth\u2019s behavior became so erratic that for the next two evenings Donald stayed off work to care for the baby, but his presence only seemed to provoke her sex - ual demands. Then there was the marijuana. Before Elisabeth became pregnant, she would have an occasional toke (she called it her \u201cherbs\u201d). During the past week, not all the smells in the house had been fresh-baked cake, so Donald thought she might be at it again. Yesterday Elisabeth had shaken him awake at 5 a.m. and announced, \u201cI am becom- ing God.\u201d That was when he had made the appointment to bring her for an evaluation. Elisabeth herself could hardly sit still during the interview. In a burst of speech, she described her renewed energy and plans for the bakery. She volunteered that she had never felt better in her life. In rapid succession she then described her mood (ecstatic), how it made her feel when she put on her best silk dress (sexy), where she had purchased the dress, how old she had been when she bought it, and to whom she was married at the time. Patients who may have bipolar I disorder need a careful interview for symptoms of addic- tion to alcohol; alcohol use disorder is diagnosed as a comorbid disorder in as many as 30%.

Often the alcohol- related symptoms appear first. Evaluation of Elisabeth Jacks This vignette provides a fairly typical picture of manic excitement. Elisabeth Jacks\u2019s mood was definitely elevated. Aside from the issue of marijuana smoking (which appeared to be a symptom, not a cause), her relatively late age of onset was the only atypical feature. For at least a week Elisabeth had had this high mood (manic episode criterion A), 132 MOOD DISOrDErS accompanied by most of the other typical symptoms (B): reduced need for sleep (B2), talkativeness (B3), flight of ideas (a sample run is given at the end of the vignette, B4), and poor judgment (buying Christmas gifts at the April garage sale\u2014B7). Her disorder caused considerable distress, for her family if not for her (C); this is usual for patients with manic episode. The severity of the symptoms (not their number or type) and the degree of impairment were what would differentiate her full-blown manic episode from a hypomanic episode. The issue of another medical condition (D) is not addressed in the vignette. Medi- cal problems such as hyperthyroidism, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors would have to be ruled out by the admitting clinician before a definitive diagnosis could be made. Delirium must be ruled out for any postpartum patient, but she was able to focus her attention well. Although Elisabeth may have been smoking marijuana, mis- use of this substance should never be confused with mania; neither cannabis intoxica - tion nor withdrawal presents the combination of symptoms typical of mania. Although the depression that occurred early in her pregnancy would have met the criteria for major depressive episode, her current manic episode would obviate major depressive disorder. Because the current episode was too severe for hypomanic symptoms, she could not have cyclothymic disorder. Therefore, the diagnosis would have to be bipo- lar I disorder (because she was hospitalized, it could not be bipolar II). The course of her illness was not compatible with any psychotic disorder other than brief psychotic disorder, and that diagnosis specifically excludes a bipolar disorder (B).

The course of her illness was not compatible with any psychotic disorder other than brief psychotic disorder, and that diagnosis specifically excludes a bipolar disorder (B). The bipolar I subtypes, as described earlier, are based upon the nature of the most recent episode. Elisabeth\u2019s, of course, would be current episode manic. Next we\u2019ll score the severity of Elisabeth\u2019s mania (see the footnotes to Table 3.2). These severity codes are satisfactorily self- explanatory, though there\u2019s one problem: Whether Elisabeth was actually psychotic is not made clear in the vignette. If we take her words literally, she thought she was becoming God, in which case she would qualify for severe with psychotic features . These would be judged mood- congruent because grandiosity was in keeping with her exalted mood. The only possible episode specifier (Table 3.3) would be with peripartum onset : She developed her manic episode within a few days of delivery. With a GAF score of 25, the full diagnosis would be as follows: F31.2 [296.44] Bipolar I disorder, currently manic, severe with mood- congruent psychotic features, with peripartum onset Winona Fisk By the time she was 21, Winona Fisk had already had two lengthy mental health hos - pitalizations, one each for mania and depression. Then she remained well for a year on maintenance lithium, which in the spring of her junior year in college she abruptly discontinued because she \u201cfelt so well.\u201d When two of her brothers brought her to the Bipolar I Disorder 133 hospital 10 days later, she had been suspended for repeatedly disrupting classes with her boisterous behavior. On the ward, Winona\u2019s behavior was mostly a picture of manic excitement. She spoke nonstop and was constantly on the move, often rummaging through other patients\u2019 purses and lockers. But many of the thoughts flooding her mind were so sad that for 8 or 10 days she often spontaneously wept for several minutes at a time. She said she felt depressed and guilty\u2014not for her behavior in class, but for being such a burden to her family. During these brief episodes, she claimed to hear the heart of her father beating from his grave, and she would express the wish to join him in death.

    "a burden to her family. During these brief episodes, she claimed to hear the heart of her father beating from his grave, and she would express the wish to join him in death. She ate little and lost 15 pounds; she often awakened weeping at night and was unable to get back to sleep. Nearly a month\u2019s treatment with lithium, carbamazepine, and neuroleptics was largely futile. Her mood disorder eventually yielded to six sessions of bilateral ECT. Evaluation of Winona Fisk Winona\u2019s two previous episodes of bipolar I disorder make that diagnosis crystal clear. Our only remaining task is to decide about the type and severity of the most recent episode. In a typical manner, Winona\u2019s manic episode began with feeling \u201ctoo good\u201d to be ill; that got her into trouble with her lithium. Her symptoms, which included poor judgment (she was suspended from class for her behavior), talkativeness, and increased psychomotor activity fulfilled criteria A and B for manic episode; hospitalization (C) ruled out hypomanic episode. (Her clinician would have to make sure she had no other medical or substance use disorder\u2014 criterion D.) But at times throughout the day, she also had \u201cmicrodepressions\u201d during which she experienced at least three depressive symptoms, which would fulfill the criterion A requirements for the specifier with mixed features (manic episode): She felt depressed (A1), she expressed feelings of (inappropriate) guilt (A5), and she ruminated about death (A6). We cannot include her problems with sleep and appetite/weight; because they are found in both manic and depressive episodes, they don\u2019t make the mixed features list. She didn\u2019t meet full major depressive criteria, so there\u2019s no need to fuss about whether to call her episode manic with mixed features, or major depressive with mixed features (C). And she didn\u2019t drink or use drugs (D). The severity of Winona\u2019s episode should be judged on the basis of both the symp- tom count and the degree to which her illness affected her (and others). All things con- sidered, her clinician felt that she was seriously ill, and coded her accordingly. With a GAF score of 25, here\u2019s Winona\u2019s diagnosis: F31.2 [296.44] Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with mood- congruent psychotic features, with mixed features Z55.9 [V62.3] Academic or educational problem (suspended from school) 134 MOOD DISOrDErS F31.81 [296.89] Bipolar II Disorder The symptoms of bipolar II and bipolar I disorders have important similarities.

The principal distinction, however, is the degree of disability and discomfort conferred by the high phase, which in bipolar II never involves psychosis and never requires hos - pitalization.* Bipolar II disorder consists of recurrent major depressive episodes inter- spersed with hypomanic episodes. Like bipolar I disorder, bipolar II may be diagnosed on the basis of mood episodes that arise spontaneously or that are precipitated by antidepressants, ECT, or bright light therapy\u2014if the induced symptoms subsequently last past the expected duration of the physiological treatment effects. (Be sure to ask the patient and informants whether there has been another hypomanic episode that was not precipitated by treatment; many patients will have had one.) Bipolar II is also associated with an especially high rate of rapid cycling, which carries added risk for a difficult course of illness. Women may be more prone than men to develop bipolar II disorder (the sexes are about equally represented in bipolar I disorder); fewer than 1% of the general adult population are affected, though the prevalence among adolescents may be higher. The peripartum period may be especially likely to precipitate an episode of hypomania. Comorbidity is a way of life for patients with bipolar II. Mostly they will have anxiety and substance use disorders, though eating disorders will also be in the mix, especially for female patients. It is important to note that although I have earlier described hypomanic episode as \u201cmania lite,\u201d we shouldn\u2019t imagine that the disorder is innocuous. Indeed, some studies suggest that patients with bipolar II are ill longer and spend more time in the depres - sive phase than is the case for patients with bipolar I. They may also be especially likely to make impulsive suicide attempts. And not a few (in the 10% range) will eventually experience a full-blown manic episode.

Iris McMaster \u201cI\u2019m a writer,\u201d said Iris McMaster. It was her first visit to the interviewer\u2019s office, and she wanted to smoke. She fiddled with a cigarette but didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with it. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do for a living. I should be home doing it now\u2014it\u2019s my life. Maybe I\u2019m the finest creative writer since Dostoevsky. But my friend Charlene said I should come in, so I\u2019ve taken time away from working on my play and my comic novel, and here I am.\u201d She finally put the cigarette back into the pack. \u201cWhy did Charlene think you should come?\u201d \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m high. Of course I\u2019m high. I\u2019m always high when I\u2019m in my creative phase. Only she thinks I\u2019m too nervous.\u201d Iris was slender and of average height; she wore a bright pink spring outfit. She looked longingly at her pack of cigarettes. \u201cGod, I need one of those.\u201d Her speech could always be interrupted, but it was salted with bon mots, neat turns of phrase, and original similes. But Iris was also able to give a coherent history. At 45, she was married to an engineer and had a daughter who was nearly 18. And she really was a writer, who over the last several years had sold (mainly to women\u2019s maga - zines) articles about a variety of subjects.

    "and had a daughter who was nearly 18. And she really was a writer, who over the last several years had sold (mainly to women\u2019s maga - zines) articles about a variety of subjects. For 3 or 4 months Iris had been in one of her high phases, cranking out an enor - mous volume of essays on wide- ranging topics. Her \u201cwired\u201d feeling was uncomfortable in a way, but it hadn\u2019t troubled her because she felt so productive. Whenever she was creating, she didn\u2019t need much sleep. A 2-hour nap would leave her rested and ready for another 10 hours at her computer. At those times, her husband would fix his own meals and kid her about having \u201ca one-track mind.\u201d Iris never ate much during her high phases, so she lost weight. But she didn\u2019t get herself into trouble: no sexual indiscretions, no excessive spending (\u201cI\u2019m always too busy to shop\u201d). And she volunteered that she had never \u201cseen visions, heard voices, or had funny ideas about people following me around.\u201d She had never spent time \u201cin the funny farm.\u201d As Iris paused to gather her thoughts, her fingers clutched the cigarette package. She shook her head almost imperceptibly. Without uttering another word, she grabbed her purse, arose from the chair, and swooped out the door. It was the last the inter - viewer saw of her for a year and a half. In November of the following year, a person announcing herself as Iris McMaster 136 MOOD DISOrDErS dropped into that same office chair. She seemed like an impostor. She\u2019d gained 30 or 40 pounds, which she had stuffed into polyester slacks and a bulky knit sweater. \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d were the first words she uttered. Just for a second, the corners of her mouth twitched up. But for the rest of the hour she soberly talked about her latest problem: writer\u2019s block. About a year ago, she had finished her play and was well into her comic novel when the muse deserted her. For months now, she had been arising around lunchtime and spending long afternoons staring at her computer. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t even turn it on!\u201d she said. She couldn\u2019t focus her thinking to create anything that seemed worth clicking on \u201csave.\u201d Most nights she tumbled into bed at 9.

For months I haven\u2019t been interested enough to cook for myself.\u201d She hadn\u2019t been suicidal, but the only time she felt much better was when Charlene took her out to lunch. Then she ate and made conversation pretty much as she used to. \u201cI\u2019ve done that quite a lot recently, as anyone can see.\u201d Once she returned home, the depression flooded back. Finally, Iris apologized for walking out a year and a half earlier. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was the least bit sick,\u201d she said, \u201cand all I really wanted to do was get back to my com- puter and get your character on paper!\u201d Evaluation of Iris McMaster This discussion will focus on the episode of elevated mood Iris had during her first visit. There are two possibilities for such an episode: manic and hypomanic. As far as the time requirement was concerned, either type was possible\u2014 hypomanic requires 4 days (hypomanic episode criterion A), manic 1 week. She admitted that she felt \u201cwired,\u201d and this feeling had apparently been sustained for several months. It was also abnormal for her. During her high phase, she had at least four symptoms (three required, B): high self- esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, and increased goal- directed activ- ity (writing). The mood of either a manic or hypomanic episode is excessively high or irritable, and it is accompanied by increased energy and activity. The real distinction between hypomania and mania consists in the effects of the mood elevation on patient and sur- roundings. The patient\u2019s functioning during a manic episode is markedly impaired, whereas in a hypomanic episode it is only a clear change from normal for the individual (C) that others can notice (D). During her high spells, Iris\u2019s writing productivity actu - ally increased, and her social relationships (those with her husband and friends, though perhaps not with her hapless clinician) did not appear to suffer (E). Note that the col - lective effect of criteria C, D, and E is to allow some impairment",
    "high spells, Iris\u2019s writing productivity actu - ally increased, and her social relationships (those with her husband and friends, though perhaps not with her hapless clinician) did not appear to suffer (E). Note that the col - lective effect of criteria C, D, and E is to allow some impairment of functioning, just not very much. Assuming that Iris had no other medical conditions or substance- induced mood disorder (F), she could have one of these three: bipolar I, bipolar II, or cyclothymic Bipolar II Disorder 137 disorder. Judging from her lack of psychosis and hospitalizations, Iris had never had a true mania, ruling out bipolar I disorder. Her mood swings weren\u2019t nearly numerous enough to qualify for a diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder. That leaves bipolar II disorder. But to qualify for that diagnosis, there must be at least one major depressive episode (bipolar II criterion A). On Iris\u2019s second visit to the clinician, her depressive symptoms included feeling depressed most of the time, weight gain, hypersomnia, fatigue, and poor concentration (her \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d), which fulfill the criterion A requirements for major depressive episode. If her depression had not met the criteria for major depressive episode, her diagnosis would have been unspeci- fied (or other specified ) bipolar disorder. That\u2019s the same conclusion you\u2019d reach for a patient who has never had a depression and only hypomanic episodes\u2014or, for Iris McMaster, if she\u2019d stayed the course for her first office visit. In coding bipolar II disorder, clinicians are asked to specify the most recent epi - sode. Iris\u2019s was a depression. Although bipolar II disorder provides no severity code for a hypomanic episode, we can rate her depression by the same criteria we\u2019d use for any other major depressive episode. Though she had only the minimum number of symp - toms needed for major depressive episode, her work had been seriously impaired. For that reason, moderate severity seems appropriate, and is mirrored in her GAF score of 60. If further interview revealed additional (or more serious) symptoms, I\u2019d consider boosting her to severe level. These specifiers leave leeway for the clinician\u2019s judgment. During her depression Iris had a number of symptoms of an episode specifier: with atypical features . That is, her mood seemed to brighten when she was having lunch with her friend; she also gained weight, slept excessively, and had a sensation of heaviness (bricks) in her limbs.",
    "clinician\u2019s judgment. During her depression Iris had a number of symptoms of an episode specifier: with atypical features . That is, her mood seemed to brighten when she was having lunch with her friend; she also gained weight, slept excessively, and had a sensation of heaviness (bricks) in her limbs. With a total of four of these symptoms (only three are required), at the time of the second interview her full diagnosis would read as follows: F31.81 [296.89] Bipolar II disorder, depressed, moderate, with atypical features Additional Mood Disorders As we\u2019ve discussed so far, many of the mood disorders seen in a mental health practice can be diagnosed by referring to manic, hypomanic, and major depressive episodes. These three mood episodes must be considered for any patient with mood symptoms. Next we\u2019ll consider several other conditions that do not depend on these episodes for their definition. F34.1 [300.4] Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) The condition discussed here goes by several names\u2014 dysthymic disorder, dysthy - mia, chronic depression, and now persistent depressive disorder . Whatever you call it 138 MOOD DISOrDErS (I\u2019ll generally stick with dysthymia ), these patients are indeed chronically depressed. For years at a time, they have many of the same symptoms found in major depres - sive episodes, including low mood, fatigue, hopelessness, trouble concentrating, and problems with appetite and sleep. But notice what\u2019s absent from this list of symptoms (and from the criteria): inappropriate guilt feelings and thoughts of death or suicidal ideas. In short, most of these patients have an illness that\u2019s enduring, but also relatively mild. In the course of a lifetime, perhaps 6% of adults have dysthymia, with women about twice as often affected as men. Although it can begin at any age, late onset is uncommon, and the classic case starts so quietly and so early in life that some patients regard their habitual low mood as, well, normal. In the distant past, clinicians regarded these patients as having depressive personality or depressive neurosis. Dysthymic patients suffer quietly, and their disability can be subtle: they tend to put much of their energy into work, with less left over for social aspects of life. Because they don\u2019t appear severely disabled, such individuals may go without treatment until their symptoms worsen into a more readily diagnosed major depressive episode. This is the fate of many, probably most, dysthymic patients. In 1993 this phenomenon was",
    "into work, with less left over for social aspects of life. Because they don\u2019t appear severely disabled, such individuals may go without treatment until their symptoms worsen into a more readily diagnosed major depressive episode. This is the fate of many, probably most, dysthymic patients. In 1993 this phenomenon was recounted in a book that made The New York Times best- seller list: Listening to Prozac. However, the astonishing response to medication that book reported is by no means limited to one drug. DSM-IV differentiated between dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive disor - der, but research has not borne out the distinction. So what DSM-5 now calls persistent depressive disorder is a combination of the two separate DSM-IV conditions. The current criteria supply some specifiers to indicate the difference. Here\u2019s what\u2019s clear: Patients who have depression that goes on and on (whatever we choose to call it) tend to respond poorly to treatment, are highly likely to have relatives with either bipolar disorders or some form of depression, and continue to be ill at follow-up. There\u2019s one other feature that results from the lumping together of dysthymia and chronic major depression. because some major depression symptoms do not occur in the dysthymia criteria set, it is possible (as DSM-5 notes) that a few patients with chronic major depression won\u2019t meet criteria for dysthymia: The combination of psychomotor slowing, suicidal ideas, and low mood/energy/interest would fit that picture (of those symptoms, only low energy appears among the b criteria for dysthymia). Improbable, I know, but there you are. We are advised that such patients should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder if their symptoms meet criteria during the current episode; if not, we\u2019ll have to retreat to other specified (or unspecified) depressive disorder.

He was 18 when he first noticed that most of the time he \u201cjust felt down.\u201d Although he was bright and studied hard, throughout college he was often distracted by thoughts that he didn\u2019t measure up to his classmates. He landed a job with a leading electronics firm, but turned down sev - eral promotions because he felt that he could not cope with added responsibility. It took dogged determination and long hours of work to compensate for this \u201cinherent second- rateness.\u201d The effort left him chronically tired. Even his marriage and the birth of his two daughters only relieved his gloom for a few weeks at a time, at best. His self- confidence was so low that, by common consent, his wife always made most of their family\u2019s decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always been. I am a professional pessimist,\u201d Noah told his family doctor one day when he was in his early 30s. The doctor replied that he had a depres - sive personality. For many years, that description seemed to fit. Then, when Noah",
    "their family\u2019s decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always been. I am a professional pessimist,\u201d Noah told his family doctor one day when he was in his early 30s. The doctor replied that he had a depres - sive personality. For many years, that description seemed to fit. Then, when Noah was in his early 40s, his younger daughter left home for college; after this, he began to feel increasingly that life had passed him by. Over a period of several months, his depression deepened. He had worsened to the point that he now felt he had never really been depressed before. Even visits from his daughters, which had always cheered him up, failed to improve his outlook. Usually a sound sleeper, Noah began awakening at about 4 a.m. and ruminating over his mistakes. His appetite fell off, and he lost weight. When for the third time in a week his wife found him weeping in their bedroom, he confessed that he had felt so guilty about his failures that he thought they\u2019d all be better off without him. She decided that he needed treatment. Noah was started on an antidepressant medication. Within 2 weeks, his mood had brightened and he was sleeping soundly; at 1 month, he had \u201cnever felt better\u201d in his life. Whereas he had once avoided oral presentations at work, he began to look forward to them as \u201ca chance to show what I could do.\u201d His chronic fatigue faded, and he began jogging to use up some of his excess energy. In his spare time, he started his own small business to develop and promote some of his engineering innovations. Noah remained on his medication thereafter. On the two or three occasions when he and his therapist tried to reduce it, he found himself relapsing into his old, depres - sive frame of mind. He continued to operate his small business as a sideline. Evaluation of Noah Sanders For most of his adult life, Noah\u2019s mood symptoms were chronic, rather than acute or recurring. He was never without these symptoms for longer than a few weeks at a time (criterion C for dysthymia), and they were present most of the day, most days (A). They included general pessimism, poor self-image, and chronic tiredness, though only Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) 141 two symptoms are required by criterion B.

    "at a time (criterion C for dysthymia), and they were present most of the day, most days (A). They included general pessimism, poor self-image, and chronic tiredness, though only Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) 141 two symptoms are required by criterion B. His indecisiveness encouraged his wife to assume the role of family decision maker, which suggests social impairment (H). The way he felt was not different from his usual self; in fact, he said it was the way he had always been. (The extended duration is one of two main features that differentiate dysthymia from major depressive disorder. The other is that the required dysthymia symptoms are neither as plentiful nor as severe as for major depression.) Noah had had no manic or psychotic symptoms that might have us considering bipolar or psychotic disorders (E, F). The differential diagnosis of dysthymia is essentially the same as that for major depressive disorder. Mood disorder due to another medical condition and substance- induced mood disorder must be ruled out (G). The remarkable chronicity and poor self-image invite speculation that Noah\u2019s difficulties might be explained by a personal- ity disorder, such as avoidant or dependent personality disorder. The vignette does not address all the criteria that would be necessary to make those diagnoses. However, an important diagnostic principle holds that the more treatable conditions should be diagnosed (and treated) first. If, despite relief of the mood disorder, Noah continued to be shy and awkward and to have a negative self-image, only then should we consider a personality diagnosis. Now to the specifiers (Table 3.3). Though lacking psychotic symptoms, Noah had quite a number of depressive symptoms (including thoughts about death), which would suggest that he was severely ill. His dysthymia symptoms began when he was young (he first noticed them when he was just 18), so we\u2019d say that his onset was early. Noah\u2019s recent symptoms would also qualify for a major depressive episode, which had begun fairly recently and precipitated his evaluation; DSM-5 notes that a dysthymic patient can have symptoms that fulfill criteria for such an episode (D). We would therefore give him the specifier with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current epi - sode. None of the course specifiers would apply to Noah\u2019s dysthymia, but the following symptoms would meet the criteria for an episode specifier for the major depression\u2014 with melancholic features: He no longer reacted positively to pleasurable",
    "give him the specifier with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current epi - sode. None of the course specifiers would apply to Noah\u2019s dysthymia, but the following symptoms would meet the criteria for an episode specifier for the major depression\u2014 with melancholic features: He no longer reacted positively to pleasurable stimuli (being with his daughters); he described his mood as a definite change from normal; and he reported guilt feelings, early morning awakening, and loss of appetite. Once treated, Noah seemed to undergo a personality change. His mood light - ened and his behavior changed to the point that, by contrast, he seemed almost hypo - manic. However, these symptoms don\u2019t rise to the level required for a hypomanic epi- sode; had that been the case, criterion E would exclude the diagnosis of dysthymia. (Also, remember that a hypomanic episode precipitated by treatment that does not extend past the physiological effects of treatment does not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. It should not count against the diagnosis of dysthymia, either.) I thought his GAF score would be about 50 on first evaluation; his GAF would be a robust 90 at follow-up. In the summary, I\u2019d note the possibility of avoidant personality traits. My full diagnosis for Noah Sanders would be as follows: 142 MOOD DISOrDErS F34.1 [300.4] Persistent mood disorder, severe, early onset, with intermittent major depressive episode, with current episode, with melancholic features (whew!) F34.0 [301.13] Cyclothymic Disorder Patients with cyclothymic disorder (CD) are chronically either elated or depressed, but for the first couple of years , they do not fulfill criteria for a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode. Note that there\u2019s a phrase back there dripping with italics. I\u2019ll explain in the sidebar below. Cyclothymic disorder was at one time regarded as a personality disorder. This may have been partly due to the fact that it begins so gradually and lasts such a long time. Articles in the literature still refer to cyclothymic temperament, which may be a precur- sor to bipolar disorders. The clinical appearance can be very variable. Some patients are nearly always dysphoric, occasionally shifting into hypomania for a day or so. Others can shift several times in a single day. Often the presentation is mixed. Typically beginning gradually in adolescence or young adulthood, CD affects under 1% of the general population. However, clinicians diagnose it even less often than you\u2019d",
    "always dysphoric, occasionally shifting into hypomania for a day or so. Others can shift several times in a single day. Often the presentation is mixed. Typically beginning gradually in adolescence or young adulthood, CD affects under 1% of the general population. However, clinicians diagnose it even less often than you\u2019d expect. The sex distribution is about equal, though women are more likely to come for treatment. Not surprisingly, patients usually only come to clinical attention when they are depressed. Once begun, it tends toward chronicity. What if your cyclothymic patient later develops a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode? In that case, you\u2019ll have to change the diagnosis to something different. Once a major mood episode rears its head, that patient can never revert to cD. If the new episode is major depressive, then you\u2019ll probably fall back on an unspecified (or other specified) bipolar disorder, inasmuch as, by definition, the \u201cup\u201d periods of c D will not qualify as a hypomanic episode. note that this is a change from DSM-IV, which allowed a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder along with cD. Essential Features of Cyclothymic Disorder The patient has had many ups and downs of mood that don\u2019t meet criteria for any of the mood episodes (major depressive, hypomanic, manic). Although symptoms occur most of the time, as much as a couple of months of level mood can go by. Cyclothymic Disorder 143 The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (2+ years; 1+ year in children and adolescents) \u2022 Distress or disabil- ity (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (sub- stance use and physical disorders, other bipolar disorders) Coding Notes Specify if: With anxious distress. Honey Bare \u201cI\u2019m a yo-yo!\u201d Without her feathers and sequins, Honey Bare looked anything but provocative. She had begun life as Melissa Schwartz, but she loved using her stage name. The stage in question was Hoofer\u2019s, one of the bump-and-grind joints that thrived near the water- front. The billboard proclaimed that it was \u201cOnly a Heartthrob Away\u201d from the Navy recruiting station. Since she\u2019d dropped out of college 4 years earlier, Honey had been a front-liner in the four-girl show at Hoofer\u2019s.

Every afternoon on her way to work she passed right by the mental health clinic, but this was her first visit inside. \u201cIn our current gig, I play the Statue of Liberty. I receive the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses. Then I take off my robes.\u201d \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d the interviewer wanted to know. Most of the time, it wasn\u2019t. Honey liked her little corner of show biz. When the fleet was in, she played to thunderous applause. \u201cIn fact, I enjoy just about everything I do. I don\u2019t drink much, and I never do drugs, but I go to parties. I sing in our church choir, go to movies\u2014I enjoy art films quite a bit.\u201d When she felt well, she slept little, talked a lot, started a hundred projects, and even finished some of them. \u201cI\u2019m really a happy person\u2014when I\u2019m feeling up.\u201d But every couple of months, there\u2019d be a week or two when Honey didn\u2019t enjoy much of anything. She\u2019d paste a smile on her face and go to work, but when the curtain rang down, the smile came off with her makeup. She was never suicidal, and her sleep and appetite didn\u2019t suffer; her energy and concentration were normal. But it was as if all the fizz had gone out of her ginger ale. She could see no obvious cause for her mood swings, which had been going on for years. She could count on the fingers of both hands the number of weeks she had been \u201cjust normal.\u201d Lately, Honey had acquired a boyfriend\u2014a chief petty officer who wanted to marry her. He said he loved her because she was so vivacious and enthusiastic, but he had only seen her when she was bubbly. Always before, when she was depressed, he had been out to sea. Now he had written that he was being transferred to shore duty, and she feared it would be the end of their relationship. As she said it, two large tears trickled through the mascara and down her cheeks. Four months and several visits later, Honey was back, wearing a smile.

She was still playing the Statue of Liberty down at Hoofer\u2019s. \u201cMy sailor\u2019s been back for nearly 3 months,\u201d she said, \u201cand he\u2019s still carrying the torch for me.\u201d as far back as the mid-19th century, Karl Kahlbaum\u2014the German psychiatrist who first described catatonia\u2014noted that some people experience frequent alterations between highs and lows so mild as not to require any treatment. His observations were confirmed and extended by his student and colleague, Ewald Hecker (who was best known for his description of hebephrenic schizophrenia). but by the mid-20th century, the first DSM described cyclothymia as a cardinal per - sonality type (along with schizoid, paranoid, and inadequate personalities). The description actually sounds pretty wonderful: \u201can extratensive and outgoing adjustment to life situa - tions, an apparent personal warmth, friendliness and superficial generosity, an emotional reaching out to the environment, and a ready enthusiasm for competition.\u201d (I\u2019ll leave the looking-up of extratensive as an extra- credit exercise.) anyway, thus was born cyclothymia as a temperament or personality style. DSM-II kept cyclothymic personality with the other personality disorders, but in 1980 it was moved to the mood disorders and rechristened with its current name. However, its relationship to other mood disorders is fraught; experts argue about it even today. Many hold that it can be prodromal to a more severe bipolar disorder. Some point out the simi- larities between cyclothymia and borderline personality disorder (labile, irritable moods leading to interpersonal conflict), even suggesting that the latter disorder belongs on the bipolar spectrum\u2014a speculation extreme enough to invite resistance. all of this suggests that we still have work to do in determining cyclothymic disorder\u2019s exact place in the diagnostic firmament. Though the DSM-5 criteria are a step along the road to differentiation of this venerable diagnosis, they may not signify any real progress. Evaluation of Honey Bare The first and most obvious question is this: Had Honey ever fulfilled criteria for a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode (cyclothymic disorder criterion C)?

    "most obvious question is this: Had Honey ever fulfilled criteria for a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode (cyclothymic disorder criterion C)? When feeling down, she had no vegetative symptoms (problems with sleep or appe - tite) of major depressive episode. She had normal concentration, had never been sui - cidal, and did not complain of feeling worthless. At the other pole, she did indeed have symptoms similar to those of hypomania (talkative, slept less, was more active than at other times), but they weren\u2019t even severe enough for hypomania. Honey\u2019s \u201cup\u201d moods weren\u2019t elevated (or irritable, or expansive) to an abnormal extent (hypomanic episode criterion A)\u2014they were her normal functioning. Furthermore, she had experienced far Cyclothymic Disorder 145 more cycles than would be typical for bipolar II disorder. We can therefore rule out any other bipolar or major depressive diagnosis. Honey testified that she was either up or down most of the time (we\u2019re back to cyclothymia\u2014 criterion B). Because she was never psychotic, she could not qualify for a diagnosis such as schizoaffective disorder (D). She didn\u2019t use drugs or alcohol, ruling out a substance- induced mood disorder (E). Again, bipolar I, bipolar II, and major depressive disorders are ruled out due to the lack of relevant episodes. (However, because they involve so many swings of mood, either bipolar I or II with rapid cycling can sometimes be confused with cyclothymic disorder.) Mood shifts, impulsivity, and interpersonal problems can of course be found aplenty in borderline personality dis- order, but we\u2019d never diagnose a personality disorder when a major mental diagnosis was available. Symptoms that were present much of the time would qualify Honey for CD. She had many mood swings; only infrequently was her mood neither high nor low. The only specifier allowed with CD, with anxious distress, didn\u2019t to me seem relevant to Honey\u2019s symptoms. With a GAF score of 70 on admission and 90 at follow-up, her diagnosis would be simple: F34.0 [301.13] Cyclothymic disorder N94.3 [625.4] Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder A long history of disagreement over the reality of premenstrual dysphoria caused it to languish in the appendices of earlier DSM editions.

    "in the appendices of earlier DSM editions. At last, enough research has been published to bring it forth from the shadows. Premenstrual symptoms to one degree or another affect about 20% of women of reproductive age. The severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PDD), affects up to 7% of women, often beginning in the teenage years. Throughout their reproductive years, these symptoms appear for perhaps a week out of each menstrual cycle. These women complain of varying degrees of dysphoric mood, fatigue, and physical symptoms that include sensitivity of breasts, weight gain, and abdominal swelling. Differentiation from major depressive episode and dysthymia relies principally on timing and duration. The consequences of PDD can be serious: Such a patient could experience mood symptoms during an accumulated 8 years of her reproductive life. Some patients may be unaware how markedly their anger and other negative moods affect those around them, and many suffer from severe depression; perhaps 15% attempt suicide. Yet the typical patient doesn\u2019t receive treatment until she is 30, sometimes even later. Symp - toms may be worse for older women, though menopause offers a natural endpoint (dura- tion is sometimes extended by hormone replacement therapy). Overall, this condition ranks high among the seriously underdiagnosed mental disorders. Risk factors for PDD include excessive weight, stress, and trauma (including a his- tory of abuse); there appears to be a robust genetic component. Comorbid are anxiety disorders and other mood disorders, including bipolar conditions. 146 MOOD DISOrDErS Dating as far back as 1944\u2014the term premenstrual tension dates at least to 1928\u2014the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has had a long and tempestuous life. It\u2019s dismissed by many as pejorative, ridiculed by would-be comics, and disparaged even by some of those who practice gender politics. It should come as no surprise that it has been so ill received; as disorders go, PMS is remarkably vague and variously defined. all told, PMS encompasses over a hundred possible symptoms, with no minimum number and no specific symptoms required; it\u2019s all anecdotal. Here are just a few: fluid retention (the symptom most often reported), especially in breasts and abdomen; craving for sweet or salty foods; muscle aches/pains, fatigue, irritability, tension, acne, anxiety, constipation or diarrhea, and insomnia; a change in sex drive; and feeling sad or moody or out of control. Most women will occasionally have one or two of these symptoms around the time of their periods\u2014these symptoms",
    "craving for sweet or salty foods; muscle aches/pains, fatigue, irritability, tension, acne, anxiety, constipation or diarrhea, and insomnia; a change in sex drive; and feeling sad or moody or out of control. Most women will occasionally have one or two of these symptoms around the time of their periods\u2014these symptoms are so common that, individually, they may be considered physiological rather than pathological. This fact causes some people to blame all such symptoms on PMS (it hardly ever goes by its full, nonabbreviated name); all women are in effect tarred with the same brush, when it is of crucial importance to note the exact symptoms, their timing, and their intensity. again, the critical difference is the presence of mood symptoms in PDD. Essential Features of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder For a few days before menstruating, a patient experiences pronounced mood shifts, depression, anxiety, anger, or other expressions of dysphoria. She will also admit to typical symptoms of depression, including trouble concentrating, loss of interest, fatigue, feeling out of control, and changes in appetite or sleep. She may have physi- cal symptoms such as sensitivity of breasts, muscle pain, weight gain, and a sensa - tion of abdominal distention. Shortly after menstruation begins, she snaps back to normal. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (for several days around menstrual periods, for most cycles during the past year) \u2022 Distress or disability (social, occupational, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use\u2014 including hormone replacement therapy; physical disorders; major depressive disorder or dysthymia; ordinary grief/sadness) Coding Note DSM-5 says that the diagnosis can only be stated as (provisional) until you\u2019ve obtained prospective ratings of two menstrual cycles. What you as a clinician decide to do with this is, of course, your business. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder 147 Amy Jernigan \u201cLook, I don\u2019t need you to tell me what\u2019s wrong. I know what\u2019s wrong. I just need you to fix it.\u201d One ankle crossed over the other, Amy Jernigan slouched in the consultation chair and gazed steadily at her clinician. \u201cI brought a list of my symptoms, just so there won\u2019t be any confusion.\u201d She unfolded a half-sheet of embossed stationery. \u201cIt always starts out 4 or 5 days before my period,\u201d she recited. \u201cI begin by feeling uptight, like I\u2019m waiting to take an exam I haven\u2019t studied for.

    "She unfolded a half-sheet of embossed stationery. \u201cIt always starts out 4 or 5 days before my period,\u201d she recited. \u201cI begin by feeling uptight, like I\u2019m waiting to take an exam I haven\u2019t studied for.

Now, while waiting for her novel to sell, she did research for a political blogger. With another glance at the paper, she continued. \u201cBut before, I\u2019m depressed, cranky, lazy as a hound dog in August, and I don\u2019t really give a shit about anything.\u201d Amy\u2019s mother, an antifeminist who\u2019d campaigned against the Equal Rights Amend- ment, had refused to validate Amy\u2019s premenstrual symptoms, though she might have had them herself. Amy\u2019s problems had begun in her early teens, almost from the time of her first period. \u201cI\u2019d be so pissed off, I\u2019d drive away all my friends. Fortunately, I\u2019m pretty outgoing, so they didn\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t\u2014stay lost for long. But reliably every month, my breasts get so sensitive they could read Braille. Then I know I\u2019d better put a lock on my tongue, or the next week I\u2019ll be buying beers for everyone I know.\u201d Amy tucked her list into her back pocket and sat up straight. \u201cI hate being the feminist with PMS\u2014I feel like a walking clich\u00e9.\u201d Discussion of Amy Jernigan As Amy said, she didn\u2019t need much discussion about what was wrong, though she didn\u2019t have her terms quite right. Her list of symptoms\u2014 depression, irritability, and ten - sion (criterion B) and breast tenderness, lethargy, and loss of interest (C)\u2014exceeds the requirement for a total of five or more. Amy herself indicated just how debilitating she considered the symptoms to be (D). The recurrence, the timing, and the absence of symptoms at times other than before her menses (A) complete a pretty airtight case. The duration of her low moods was too brief for either a major depressive episode or dysthymia (E). Of course, the usual investigation must be made to rule out any linger- ing thoughts that her symptoms could be due to substance use or another medical condition (E).

Of course, the usual investigation must be made to rule out any linger- ing thoughts that her symptoms could be due to substance use or another medical condition (E). I should note that, in the absence of a couple of months of prospective symptom recording, Amy\u2019s clinician needs to be extra careful to rule out major depres- sive disorder. It is awfully easy to ignore depressive symptoms that occur at other times of the month. Amy\u2019s clinician would have to assess her mood through two subsequent periods to comply with criterion F. When she was ill, her GAF score would be 60, and her diag - nosis should be as follows: N94.3 [625.4] Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (provisional) 148 MOOD DISOrDErS The demand for prospective data before a definitive diagnosis can be made is unique in DSM-5, and has never been required in a prior edition of the DSM. The rationale is to ensure that the diagnosis is made with the best data possible; the fact that such a step is not required for more diagnoses may be a nod to the realities of clinical practice. Even so, we may have just experienced the first breeze of a gathering storm. F34.8 [296.99] Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder New in DSM-5, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) showcases extremes of childhood. Most kids fight among themselves, but DMDD broadens the scope and intensity of battle. Minor provocations (insufficient cheese in a sandwich, a favorite shirt in the wash) can provoke these children to fly completely off the handle. In a burst of temper, they may threaten or bully siblings (and parents). Some may refuse to com - ply with chores, homework, or even basic hygiene. These outbursts occur every couple of days on average, and between them, the child\u2019s mood is persistently negative\u2014 depressed, angry, or irritable. Their behavior places these children at enormous social, educational, and emo - tional disadvantage. Low assessments of functioning reflect the trouble they have inter- acting with peers, teachers, and relatives. They require constant attention from parents, and if they go to school at all, sometimes they need minders to ensure their own safety and that of others. Some suffer such intense rage that those about them actually fear for their lives. Even relatively mild symptoms may cause children to forgo many normal childhood experiences, such",
    "parents, and if they go to school at all, sometimes they need minders to ensure their own safety and that of others. Some suffer such intense rage that those about them actually fear for their lives. Even relatively mild symptoms may cause children to forgo many normal childhood experiences, such as play dates and party invitations. In one sample, a third had been hospitalized. Perhaps as many as 80% of children with DMDD will also meet criteria for opposi- tional defiant disorder, in which case you would only diagnose DMDD. The diagnosis is more common in boys than in girls, placing it at odds with most other mood disorders, though right in line with most other childhood disorders. Although the official DSM-5 criteria remind us not to make the diagnosis prior to age 6, limited studies find that it is most common in preschool children. And it needs to be discriminated from teenage rebellion\u2014the teens are a transitional period where mood symptoms are common. The question has been asked: Why was DMDD not included in the same chapter with the disruptive, impulse- control, and conduct disorders? Of course, the original impetus was to give clinicians a mood- related alternative to bipolar I disorder. How - ever, the prominent feature of persistently depressed (or irritable) behavior throughout the course of illness seems reason enough for placement with other mood disorders. Partly because this diagnosis is intended for children, but mainly because I\u2019m really worried about the validity of a newly concocted, poorly studied formulation (see the sidebar below), I\u2019ll not provide a vignette or further discussion at this time. At the same time, I\u2019m really, really worried about all those kids who are being lumbered with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, with attendant drug treatment. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder 149 How many disorders can you name that originated in an uncomfortable bulge in the num- ber of patients being diagnosed with something else? I can think of exactly one, and here is how it came about. beginning in the mid-1990s, a few prominent a merican psychiatrists sufficiently relaxed the criteria for bipolar disorder to allow that diagnosis in children whose irritability was chronic, not episodic. Subsequently, the number of childhood bipolar diagnoses bal- looned. Many other experts howled at what they perceived to be a subversion of the bipolar criteria; thus were drawn the battle lines for diagnostic war. In aggregate,",
    "bipolar disorder to allow that diagnosis in children whose irritability was chronic, not episodic. Subsequently, the number of childhood bipolar diagnoses bal- looned. Many other experts howled at what they perceived to be a subversion of the bipolar criteria; thus were drawn the battle lines for diagnostic war. In aggregate, a number of features seem to set these youngsters well apart from traditional patients with bipolar disorder: (1) Limited follow-up studies find some increase in depression, not mania, in these children as they mature. (2) Family history studies find no excess of bipolar disorder in relatives of these patients. (3) The sex ratio is about 2:1 in favor of boys, which is disparate with the 1:1 ratio for bipolar disorder in older patients. (4) Studies of pathophysiology suggest that brain mechanisms may differentiate the two conditions. (5) The diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorder has been made far more often in the United States than elsewhere in the world. (6) Follow-up studies find far more manic or hypomanic episodes in children with bipolar disorder diagnosed according to traditional criteria than in those whose principal issue was with severe mood dysregulation. The epic internecine battle among a merican mental health professionals has been chronicled in a 2008 Frontline program (\u201cThe bipolar child\u201d) on P bS and in a New York Times Magazine article by Jennifer Egan (\u201cThe bipolar Puzzle,\u201d September 12, 2008). The dispute continues; meanwhile, the DMDD category was crafted to capture more accurately the pathology of severely irritable children. The DSM-5 committee struggled to differenti- ate the two conditions, and I suspect that the struggles have only just begun. Essential Features of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder For at least a year, several times a week, on slight provocation a child has severe tantrums\u2014 screaming or actually attacking someone (or something)\u2014that are inappro- priate for the patient\u2019s age and stage of development. Between outbursts, the child seems mostly angry, grumpy, or sad. The attacks and intervening moods occur across multiple settings (home, school, with friends). These patients have no manic episodes.

Intoxication with cocaine or amphetamines can precipitate manic symptoms, and depression can result from withdrawal from cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol, or barbiturates. Note that for the diagnosis to be tenable, it must develop in close proximity to an episode of intoxication or withdrawal from the substance, which must in turn be capable of causing the symptoms. Obviously, depression can occur with the misuse of alcohol and street drugs. (As DSM-5 notes, 40% or so of individuals with alcohol use disorder have depressive epi - sodes, of which perhaps half are alcohol- induced, non- independent events.) However, even health care professionals can fail to recognize mood disorders caused by medica - tions (see p. 643). That\u2019s why the case of Erin Finn below is a cautionary tale, probably encountered every working day in clinicians\u2019 offices around the world.

Erin Finn Erin Finn came to the clinic straight from her job as media specialist at a political campaign. She\u2019d taken part in her state\u2019s screening program for hepatitis C, which tar- geted people in her age group\u2014reared before routine testing of the blood supply had reduced the incidence of the disease. Her test had come back positive. When the RNA polymerase test revealed a viral load, she\u2019d agreed to a trial of interferon. \u201cI sometimes feel tired, but I\u2019ve had no other symptoms,\u201d she\u2019d told her doctor. Though solidly middle-class and conservatively dressed, Erin had actually had a number of possible exposures to hepatitis C. The most likely was a years-ago blood transfusion, but she\u2019d also \u201chad a wild-ish youth, experimented with injectable drugs a few times, even got a tattoo. It\u2019s more or less discreet\u2014the tattoo, I mean.\u201d Within a few days of starting the medication, she\u2019d begun to complain of feeling depressed, first mildly, then increasing day by day. \u201cIt felt worse than that day last year when we thought we\u2019d lost in the primary election,\u201d she told the interviewer. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horrible combination of sleeping poorly at night and never completely waking up dur- ing the day. And feeling draggy, and tired, and . . . \u201d She groped for words while fiddling with the two campaign buttons pinned to her coat.

Originally hired to do data entry, Erin had been promoted to write campaign materials for brochures and television. But because she was depressed most of the day, 152 MOOD DISOrDErS her inability to concentrate had resulted in mistakes. \u201cI\u2019m a crap worker,\u201d she said, \u201calways making simple mistakes in grammar and spelling. It\u2019ll be my fault if we lose in November.\u201d After a moment, she added, \u201cBut I\u2019m not suicidal, I\u2019m not that dumb. Or desperate. But some days, I just wish I was dead.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cWere dead!\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cAnd my boyfriend tells me I\u2019m useless in bed. Along with everything else, I just don\u2019t seem to care about that any more, either.\u201d Erin subsequently stopped the interferon, and her mood and other symptoms gradually returned to normal. \u201cSo the doctor thought I ought to try the interferon again, as a sort of challenge. At first, I said that was a total nonstarter! But then I got to worrying some more about cirrhosis, and thought I\u2019d give it another shot. So to speak.\u201d She shrugged as she rolled up her sleeve. \u201cI guess hepatitis treatment has a lot in common with politics\u2014 neither of them\u2019s bean-bag.\u201d Evaluation of Erin Finn Erin\u2019s symptoms would rate her a diagnosis of (relatively mild) major depressive epi - sode, even leaving out the fatigue (which we won\u2019t count because it antedated her use of interferon). Even without all those depressive symptoms, the mere fact of having such a pronounced low mood would fulfill the requirement for medication- induced depres- sive disorder criterion A. The timing was right (B1), and interferon is well known to produce depressive symptoms in a sizeable number of patients (though more often in those who have had previous mood episodes\u2014B2). And, although it was hardly a con - trolled experiment, her depressive symptoms did clear up right away, once she stopped the interferon. DSM-5 doesn\u2019t specify a challenge test (sometimes such a test is inad - visable), but a return of Erin\u2019s depressive symptoms after she resumed the medication would forge the final cause-and- effect link. OK, so we should consider other possible causes of her depression (criteria C and D). I\u2019ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. As",

OK, so we should consider other possible causes of her depression (criteria C and D). I\u2019ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. As for criterion E (distress and disability), res ipsa loquitur. When we turn to Table 15.2 in Chapter 15 for ICD-10 coding, her substance was \u201cOther\u201d (F19), and she had obviously used it only as prescribed, so there was no use disorder. Cross- indexing with the mood disorder column yields F19.94. The ICD-9 code comes from Table 15.3. I would give her GAF score as 55 on admission, 90 at discharge. F19.94 [292.84] Interferon- induced depressive disorder, with onset after medication use B18.2 [070.54] Chronic hepatitis C Mood Disorders Due to Another Medical Condition Many medical conditions can cause depressive or bipolar symptoms, and it is vital always to consider physical etiologies when evaluating a mood disorder. This is not Mood Disorders Due to Another Medical Condition 153 only because they are treatable; with today\u2019s therapeutic options, most mood disorders are highly treatable. It is because some of the general medical conditions, if left inade- quately treated too long, themselves have serious consequences\u2014 including death. And there are not a few that can cause manic symptoms. I\u2019ve mentioned some of these in the \u201cPhysical Disorders That Affect Mental Diagnosis\u201d table in the Appendix, though that table is by no means comprehensive. Note this really important requirement: The medical condition has to have been the direct, physiological cause of the bipolar or depressive symptoms. Psychological causation (for instance, the patient feels understandably terrible upon being told \u201cit\u2019s cancer\u201d) doesn\u2019t count, except as the possible precipitant for an adjustment disorder. The vignette of Lisa Voorhees below illustrates the importance of keeping in mind that medical conditions can cause mood disorders.

Each of them had thought that her problems were entirely mental. Although she had \u201cbeen 39 for several years,\u201d she was slender and smart, and she knew that she was attractive to men. She intended to stay that way. Her job as personal secretary to the chairman of the department of English and literature at a large Midwestern university introduced her to a",
    "had \u201cbeen 39 for several years,\u201d she was slender and smart, and she knew that she was attractive to men. She intended to stay that way. Her job as personal secretary to the chairman of the department of English and literature at a large Midwestern university introduced her to a lot of eligible males. And that was where Lisa first noticed the problem that made her think she was losing her mind. \u201cIt was this gorgeous assistant professor of Romance languages,\u201d she told the inter- viewer. \u201cHe was always in and out of the office, and I\u2019d done everything short of sexual Mood Disorders Due to Another Medical Condition 155 harassment to get him to notice me. Then one day last spring, he asked me out to dinner and a show. And I turned him down! I just wasn\u2019t interested. It was as if my sex drive had gone on sabbatical!\u201d For several weeks she continued to feel uninterested in men, and then one morn- ing she \u201cwoke up next to some odious creep from the provost\u2019s office\u201d she\u2019d been avoid- ing for months. She felt disgusted with herself, but they had sex again anyway, before she kicked him out. For the next several months, Lisa\u2019s sexual appetite would suddenly change every 2 or 3 weeks. Privately, she had begun to call it \u201cThe Turn of the Screw.\u201d During her active phase, she felt airy and light, and could pound away on her computer 12 hours a day. But the rest of the time, nothing pleased her. She was depressed and grouchy at the office, slept badly (and alone), and joked that her keyboard and mouse were conspiring to make her feel clumsy. Even Lisa\u2019s wrists felt weak. She had bought a wrist rest to use when she was typing, and that helped for a while. But she could find neither splint nor tonic for the fluctuations of her sex drive. One doctor told her it was \u201cthe change\u201d and prescribed estrogen; another diagnosed \u201cmanic\u2013 depression\u201d and offered lithium. A third sug - gested pastoral counseling, but instead she had come to the clinic. In frustration, Lisa arose from her chair and paced to the window and back. \u201cWait a minute\u2014do that again,\u201d the interviewer ordered. \u201cDo what? All I did was walk across the room.\u201d \u201cI know. How long have you had that limp?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Not long,",
    "come to the clinic. In frustration, Lisa arose from her chair and paced to the window and back. \u201cWait a minute\u2014do that again,\u201d the interviewer ordered. \u201cDo what? All I did was walk across the room.\u201d \u201cI know. How long have you had that limp?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Not long, I guess. What with the other problems, I hardly noticed. Does it matter?\u201d It proved to be the key. Three visits to a neurologist, some X-rays, and an MRI later, Lisa\u2019s diagnosis was multiple sclerosis. The neurologist explained that multiple sclerosis sometimes caused mood swings; treatment for it was instituted, and Lisa was referred back to the mental health clinic for psychotherapy. Evaluation of Lisa Voorhees On paper, the various criteria sets make reasonably clear-cut the differences between mood disorders with \u201cemotional\u201d causes and those caused by general medical condi - tions or substance use. In practice, it isn\u2019t always obvious. Lisa\u2019s mood symptoms alternated between periods of highs and lows. Although they lasted 2 weeks or longer, none of these extremes was severe enough to qualify as a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode. The depressed period was too brief for dysthymia; the whole episode had not lasted long enough for cyclothymic disorder; and there was no evidence of a substance-induced mood disorder. Depressive (or bipolar) disorder due to another medical condition must fulfill two important criteria. The first is that symptoms must be directly produced by physi- ological mechanisms of the illness itself, not simply by an emotional reaction to having the illness. For example, patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas are known to 156 MOOD DISOrDErS have a special risk of depression, which doesn\u2019t occur just as a reaction to the news or continuing stress of having a serious medical problem. Several lines of evidence could bear on a causal relationship between a medical condition and mood symptoms. A connection may exist if the mood disorder is more severe than the general medical symptoms seem to warrant or than the psychological impact would be on most people. However, such a connection would not be presumed if the mood symptoms begin before the patient learns of the general medical condition. Similar mood symptoms developing upon the disclosure of a different medical problem would argue against a diagnosis of either bipolar or depressive disorder due to another medical condition. By contrast, arguing for a connection would",
    "presumed if the mood symptoms begin before the patient learns of the general medical condition. Similar mood symptoms developing upon the disclosure of a different medical problem would argue against a diagnosis of either bipolar or depressive disorder due to another medical condition. By contrast, arguing for a connection would be clinical features different from those usual for a primary mood disorder (such as atypical age of onset). None of these conditions obtained in the case of Lisa Voorhees. A known pathological mechanism that can explain the development of the mood symptoms in physiological terms obviously argues strongly in favor of a causal relation- ship. Multiple sclerosis, affecting many areas of the brain, would appear to satisfy this criterion. A high percentage of patients with multiple sclerosis have reported mood swings. Periods of euphoria have also been reported in these patients; anxiety may be more common still. Many other medical conditions can cause depression. Endocrine disorders are important causes: Hypothyroidism and hypoadrenocorticalism are associated with depressive symptoms, whereas hyperthyroidism and hyperadrenocorticalism are linked with manic or hypomanic symptoms. Infectious diseases can cause depressive symp - toms (many otherwise normal people have noted lassitude and low mood when suffer - ing from a bout of the flu; Lyme disease has been getting a lot of attention recently). Space- occupying lesions of the brain (tumors and abscesses) have also been associated with depressive symptoms, as have vitamin deficiencies. Finally, about one-third of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, and stroke may develop seri- ous depressive symptoms. The second major criterion for a mood disorder due to another medical condition is that the mood symptoms must not occur only during the course of a delirium. Delirious patients can have difficulties with memory, concentration, lack of interest, episodes of tearfulness, and frank depression that closely resemble major depressive disorder. Lisa presented no evidence that suggested delirium. As to the specifier, we could choose between with manic features and with mixed features (see Essential Features, above). At different times, Lisa had both extremes of mood; neither predominated, so I\u2019d go with . . . well, see below, along with a GAF score of 70.

Severity and Remission Severity Codes Neither major depressive episode, manic episode, nor hypomanic episode is codable (stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before). Instead, we use each as the basis for other diag - noses. However, they do have severity codes attached to them, and the same sever - ity codes are used for major depressive and manic episodes. Use these codes for the current or most recent major depressive episode in major depressive, bipolar I, or bipolar II disorders, or the current or most recent manic episode in the two bipolar disorders. (Hypomanic episode is by definition relatively mild, so it gets no severity specifier.) The basic severity codes for manic and major depressive episodes are these: Mild. Symptoms barely fulfill the criteria and result in little distress or interfer - ence with the patient\u2019s ability to work, study, or socialize. Moderate. Intermediate between mild and severe. Severe. There are several symptoms more than the minimum for diagnosis, and they markedly interfere with patient\u2019s work, social, or personal functioning. Remission Codes The majority of patients with bipolar disorders recover completely between episodes (and most of them will have subsequent episodes). Still, up to a third of patients with bipolar I do not recover completely. The figures for patients with major depressive dis- order are not quite so grim. Following are two specifiers for current status of both these disorders, as well as bipolar II disorder and persistent depressive disorder (aka dysthymia). In partial remission. A patient who formerly met full criteria and now either (1) has fewer than the required number of symptoms or (2) has had no symptoms at all, but for under 2 months. In full remission. For at least 2 months, the patient has had no important symp - toms of the mood episode. 158 MOOD DISOrDErS Specifiers That Describe the Most Recent Mood Episode The episode specifiers describe features of the patient\u2019s current",
    "no symptoms at all, but for under 2 months. In full remission. For at least 2 months, the patient has had no important symp - toms of the mood episode. 158 MOOD DISOrDErS Specifiers That Describe the Most Recent Mood Episode The episode specifiers describe features of the patient\u2019s current or most recent episode of illness. No additional code number is assigned for these features; you just write out the verbiage. Again, Table 3.3 shows at a glance when you can use each of the following special qualifiers. With Anxious Distress Patients with bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic, major depressive, or persistent depres- sive disorder may experience symptoms of high anxiety. These patients may have a greater than average potential for suicide and for chronicity of illness. Essential Features of With Anxious Distress During a major depressive/manic/hypomanic episode or dysthymia, the patient feels notably edgy or tense, and may be extra restless. Typically, it is hard to focus atten - tion because of worries\u2014\u201cSomething terrible could happen,\u201d or \u201cI could lose control and [fill in the awful consequence] . . . \u201d Coding Notes Specify severity: mild (2 symptoms of anxious distress), moderate (3 symptoms), mod- erate\u2013severe (4\u20135 symptoms), severe (4\u20135 symptoms plus physical agitation) See Table 3.3 for application. There\u2019s something kind of funny here. We\u2019ve been given a mood specifier that has its own severity scale, derived (as are manic and major depressive episodes) by counting symp - toms. If there\u2019s any other place in DSM-5 where it\u2019s possible to have two separate severity ratings in the same diagnosis, I don\u2019t recall it. (Other specifiers have several symptoms to count; for example, why don\u2019t we also rate severity of with melancholic features?) Further- more, it is at least theoretically possible for a patient to have mild depression with severe anxious distress. Of course, you can rate each part independently, but it could be confus - ing and it sounds a little silly. My approach would be to focus on the severity of the mood episode. The specifier will probably get along just fine on its own. Specifiers That Describe the Most r ecent Mood Episode 159 With Atypical Features Not all seriously depressed patients have the classic vegetative symptoms typical of melancholia (see below).

    "Describe the Most r ecent Mood Episode 159 With Atypical Features Not all seriously depressed patients have the classic vegetative symptoms typical of melancholia (see below). Patients who have atypical features seem almost the reverse: Instead of sleeping and eating too little, they sleep and eat too much. This pattern is especially common among younger (teenage and college-age) patients. Indeed, it is common enough that it might better be called nonclassic depression . Two reasons make it important to specify with atypical features . First, because such patients\u2019 symptoms often include anxiety and sensitivity to rejection, they risk being mislabeled as having an anxiety disorder or a personality disorder. Second, they may respond differently to treatment than do patients with melancholic features. Atypi- cal patients may respond to specific antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), and may also show a favorable response to bright light therapy for seasonal (winter) depression. Iris McMaster\u2019s bipolar II disorder included atypical features (p. 136). Essential Features of With Atypical Features A patient experiencing a major depressive episode feels better when something good happens (\u201cmood reactivity,\u201d which obtains whether the patient is depressed or well). The patient also has other atypical symptoms: an increase in appetite or weight (the classic depressed patient reports a decrease), excessive sleeping (as opposed to insomnia), a feeling of being sluggish or paralyzed, and long- existing (not just when depressed) sensitivity to rejection. The Fine Print The with atypical features specifier cannot be used if your patient also has melancho- lia or catatonic features. See Table 3.3 for application. With Catatonia The catatonia specifier, first mentioned in Chapter 2 in association with the psychotic disorders (p. 100), can be applied to manic and major depressive (but not hypomanic) episodes of mood disorders as well. The definitions of the various terms are given in the sidebar on page 101. When you use it, you have to add a line of extra code after listing and coding the other mental disorder: F06.1 [293.89] Catatonia associated with [state the mental disorder] I\u2019ve given an example in the case of Edward Clapham (p. 102). 160 MOOD DISOrDErS With Melancholic Features The with melancholic features specifier refers to the classical \u201cvegetative\u201d symptoms of severe depression and a negative view of the world. Melancholic patients awaken too early in the morning, feeling worse than they do later in the day. They also have reduced appetite and lose weight.",
    "DISOrDErS With Melancholic Features The with melancholic features specifier refers to the classical \u201cvegetative\u201d symptoms of severe depression and a negative view of the world. Melancholic patients awaken too early in the morning, feeling worse than they do later in the day. They also have reduced appetite and lose weight. They take little pleasure in their usual activities (including sex) and are not cheered by the presence of people whose company they normally enjoy. This loss of pleasure is not merely relative, but total or nearly so. Brian Murphy (p. 124) is an example of such a patient; Noah Sanders (p. 141) is another. Melancholic features are especially common among patients who first develop severe depression in midlife. This condition used to be called involutional melancholia, from the observation that it seemed to occur in patients who were in middle to old age (life\u2019s so- called \u201cinvolutional\u201d period). However, it is now recognized that melancholic features can affect patients of any age; they are especially likely to occur in psychotic depressions. Depression with melancholia usually responds well to somatic treatments such as antidepressant medication and ECT. Contrast this picture with that given for with atypical features (see above). Again, see Table 3.3 for details of when to apply this specifier. Essential Features of With Melancholic Features In the depths of a major depressive episode, the patient cannot find pleasure in accus- tomed activities or feels no better if something good happens (OK, could be both). Such a patient also experiences some of these: a mood more deeply depressed than what you\u2019d expect during bereavement; diurnal variation of mood (more depressed in the morning); terminal insomnia (awakening at least 2 hours early); change in psychomotor activity (sometimes agitated, more often slowed down); marked loss of appetite or weight; and guilt feelings that are unwarranted or excessive. This form of depression is extremely severe and can border on psychosis. Coding Notes You can apply this specifier to a major depressive episode, wherever it occurs: major depressive disorder (single episode or recurrent), bipolar I or II disorder, or persistent depressive disorder. See Table 3.3. With Mixed Features In 1921, Emil Kraepelin first described mixed forms of mania and depression. DSM-IV and its predecessors included a mixed episode among the mood disorders.

    "3.3. With Mixed Features In 1921, Emil Kraepelin first described mixed forms of mania and depression. DSM-IV and its predecessors included a mixed episode among the mood disorders. Now that it\u2019s been retired, DSM-5 offers a with mixed features specifier to use with patients who within the same time frame have symptoms of depression and mania (or hypomania). Specifiers That Describe the Most r ecent Mood Episode 161 The features of the two opposite poles occur more or less at the same time, though some patients experience the gradual introduction (then fading away) of, say, depression into a manic episode. However, researchers are only just ascertaining the degree to which such a patient differs from someone with \u201cpure\u201d episodic mania or depression. Patients who have mixed features appear to have more total episodes and more depressive episodes, and remain ill longer. They may tend to have more comorbid mental illness and greater suicide risk. Their work is more likely to be impaired. Patients with major depressive disorder who have mixed features are especially likely to develop a bipolar disorder in the future. Despite this attention, we\u2019ll probably continue to use the with mixed features spec- ifier less often than could be justified. Several studies suggest that a third or more of bipolar patients have at least one episode with mixed symptoms; some reports suggest that mixed mood states are more frequent in women than in men. You can apply this specifier to episodes of major depression, mania, and hypomania (see Table 3.3). Because of the greater impairment and overall severity of mania symp- toms, if you have a patient who meets full criteria for both mania and major depression, you should probably go with the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder with mixed features, rather than major depressive disorder with mixed features. Winona Fisk (p. 133) had bipolar I disorder with mixed features. The criteria for with mixed features omit some of the mood symptoms found in manic and major depressive episodes. That\u2019s because they might conceivably belong on both lists, and hence do not indicate a mixed presentation. These symptoms include certain problems with sleep, appetite/weight, irritability, agitation, and concentration. note, by the way, that the patient must meet full criteria for major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode. The criteria are silent as to how long each day (or, actually, the majority of days) the mixed features must be present,",
    "include certain problems with sleep, appetite/weight, irritability, agitation, and concentration. note, by the way, that the patient must meet full criteria for major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode. The criteria are silent as to how long each day (or, actually, the majority of days) the mixed features must be present, and I don\u2019t know of any data that would help us understand this question better. Right now, even a few minutes a day, repeated day after day, would seem enough to earn this specifier. Only additional research is going to help us understand whether that\u2019s a sensible time frame\u2014or too short, or too long. Right now, that picture is decidedly mixed. Essential Features of With Mixed Features Here, there are two ways to go. A patient with a manic or hypomanic episode also has some noticeable symp - toms of depression most days: depressed mood, low interest or pleasure in activities, an activity level that is speeded up or slowed down, feeling tired, 162 MOOD DISOrDErS feeling worthless or guilty, and repeated thoughts about death or suicide. (See Coding Note.) A patient with major depressive episode also has some noticeable symptoms of mania most days: heightened mood, grandiosity, increased talkative - ness, flight of ideas, increased energy level, poor judgment (such as exces - sive spending, sexual adventures, imprudent financial speculations), and reduced need for sleep. The Fine Print The D: \u2022 Differential diagnosis (physical disorders, substance use disorders) Coding Note The impairment and severity of full-blown mania suggest that patients who simulta- neously meet full episode criteria for both manic and depressive episodes should be recorded as having manic episode, with mixed features. With Peripartum Onset Over half of all women have \u201cbaby blues\u201d after giving birth: They may feel sad and anx- ious, cry, complain of poor attention, and have trouble sleeping. This lasts a week or two and is usually of little consequence. But about 10% of women have enough symptoms to be diagnosed as having a depressive disorder; these people often have a personal his- tory of mental disorder. An episode of hypomania may be especially likely after child - birth. Only about 2 out of 1,000 new mothers actually become psychotic. The with peripartum onset specifier has the briefest Essential Features in this book.

Though Elisabeth Jacks had a manic episode after giving birth (see p. 131), a major depressive episode would be much the more common response. With peripartum onset can apply to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, to either type of major depressive disorder, or to brief psychotic disorder (see Table 3.3 for all applications except to brief psychotic disorder). Essential Features of With Peripartum Onset A female patient\u2019s mood disorder starts during pregnancy or within a month of giv- ing birth. Coding Notes See Table 3.3 for application. Specifiers That Describe the Most r ecent Mood Episode 163 In the mood disorders, it\u2019s called with peripartum onset. However, when it occurs with brief psychotic disorder, it\u2019s called with postpartum onset, even though it\u2019s described there as occurring \u201cduring pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum.\u201d This is just one more little glitch that will probably get sorted out, by and by. Use it either way in any context, and you\u2019re still likely to be understood. With Psychotic Features Irrespective of the severity rating, some patients with manic or major depressive epi - sodes will have delusions or hallucinations. (Of course, most of these patients you will have rated as being severely ill, but it is at least theoretically possible that some - one could have just a few symptoms\u2014 including psychosis\u2014that for whatever reason haven\u2019t hugely inconvenienced them.) Around half of patients with bipolar I disorder will have psychotic symptoms; far fewer patients with major depressive disorder will be psychotic. Psychotic symptoms may be mood- congruent or mood- incongruent. Specify, if possible: With mood- congruent psychotic features. The content of the patient\u2019s delusions or hallucinations is completely in accord with the usual themes of the relevant mood episode. For major depression, these include death, disease, guilt, delusions of nihilism (nothingness), personal inadequacy, or punishment that is deserved; for mania, they include exaggerated ideas of identity, knowledge, power, self-worth, or relationship to God or someone else famous. With mood- incongruent psychotic features. The content of the patient\u2019s delusions or hallucinations is not in accord with the usual themes of the mood episode. For both mania and major depression, these include delusions of persecution, control, thought broadcasting, and thought insertion. Essential Features of With",

They don\u2019t match. 164 MOOD DISOrDErS Specifiers That Describe Episode Patterns Two specifiers describe the frequency or timing of mood episodes. Their appropriate uses are summarized below in Table 3.3, as are those for the other types of specifiers. With Rapid Cycling Typically, the bipolar disorders follow a more or less indolent course: a number of months (perhaps 3\u20139) of depression, followed by somewhat fewer months of mania or hypomania. Other than their number, the individual episodes meet full criteria for major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episodes. As patients age, the entire cycle tends to speed up, but most patients have no more than one up-and-down cycle per year, even after five or more complete cycles. Some patients, however, especially women, cycle much more rapidly than this: They may go from mania to depression to mania again within a few weeks. (Their symptoms meet full mood episode requirements\u2014that\u2019s how they differ from cyclothymic disorder.) Recent research suggests that patients who cycle rapidly are more likely to originate from higher socioeconomic classes; in addition, a past history of rapid cycling predicts that this pattern will continue in the future. Rapid cyclers may be more difficult to man- age with standard maintenance regimens than other patients, and they may have a poorer overall prognosis. With rapid cycling can apply to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. Essential Features of With rapid Cycling A patient has four or more episodes per year of major depression, mania, or hypo - mania. Coding Notes To count as a separate episode, an episode must be marked by remission (part or full) for 2+ months or by a change in polarity (such as from manic to major depres - sive episode). With Seasonal Pattern Here is yet another specifier for mood disorders that has only been recognized in the last few decades. In the usual pattern, depressive symptoms",
    "remission (part or full) for 2+ months or by a change in polarity (such as from manic to major depres - sive episode). With Seasonal Pattern Here is yet another specifier for mood disorders that has only been recognized in the last few decades. In the usual pattern, depressive symptoms (these are often also atypi- cal) appear during fall or winter months and remit in the spring and summer. Patients with winter depression may report other difficulties, such as pain disorder symptoms or a craving for carbohydrates, during their depressed phase. Winter depressions occur more commonly in polar climates, especially in the far North, and younger people may be more susceptible. With seasonal pattern can apply to bipolar I and bipolar II disor - Specifiers That Describe Episode Patterns 165 ders and to major depressive disorder, recurrent type. There may also be seasonality to manic symptoms, although this is far less well established. (Bipolar I patients may experience the seasonal pattern with one type of episode, not with the other.) Sal Camozzi\u2019s bipolar II disorder included a seasonal pattern. His history is pre - sented in Chapter 11 (p. 304). Essential Features of With Seasonal Pattern The patient\u2019s mood episodes repeatedly begin (and end) at about the same times of year. The seasonal episodes have been the only episodes for at least the past 2 years. Lifelong, seasonal episodes materially outnumber nonseasonal ones The Fine Print Disregard examples where there is a clear seasonal cause, such as being laid off every summer. Putting It All Together: Coding and Labeling the Mood Disorders Coding and labeling the mood disorders, especially major depressive disorder and bipolar I disorder, have always been complex undertakings\u2014and DSM-5 and ICD-10 have further complicated them. Table 3.2 lays out the possible codes for bipolar I and major depressive disorders. A footnote to this table give two examples of how to label particular presentations of these disorders. In addition to the three bipolar types listed in Table 3.2, there is also the possibility of bipolar I, unspecified type. That\u2019s mainly intended for the folks in the record room when we neglect to indicate the polarity of the most recent episode. We clinicians should ordinarily have little occasion to use this code. b ecause the episode type is unknown, no episode specifiers can apply. Table 3.3 (p. 168) summarizes all the descriptors and specifiers that can apply to mood",
    "when we neglect to indicate the polarity of the most recent episode. We clinicians should ordinarily have little occasion to use this code. b ecause the episode type is unknown, no episode specifiers can apply. Table 3.3 (p. 168) summarizes all the descriptors and specifiers that can apply to mood disorders, and indicates with which disorders each modifier can be used. DSM-5 doesn\u2019t say that the depression of bipolar II disorder can have atypical, melan - cholic, or psychotic features. but neither does it say that it can\u2019t. I say that if you encounter a patient with bipolar II disorder who has any of those features, step right up and declare it. It\u2019ll do you a world of good. 166 MOOD DISOrDErS Other Specified and Unspecified Mood Disorders F31.89 [296.89] Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder Use other specified bipolar and related disorder when you want to write down the spe- cific reason your patient cannot receive a more definite bipolar diagnosis. To prevent overuse and \u201cmedicalization\u201d of the normal ebb and flow of mood, the patient must have symptoms that don\u2019t qualify for a more specific bipolar disorder diagnosis and that cause distress or interfere with the patient\u2019s normal functioning. DSM-5 gives a number of examples: Short- duration hypomanic episodes (2\u20133 days) and major depressive episodes. Such a patient will have had at least one fully qualified major depressive episode, plus at least one episode of hypomania too brief (2\u20133 days) to justify a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. Because the depression and hypomania don\u2019t occur together, a with mixed features designation wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. TABLE 3.2.

Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive episodes. Such a patient will have had least one major depressive episode but no actual manic or hypomanic episodes, though there will have been at least one episode of sub - threshold hypomania . That is, the high phase is long enough (4 days or more) but is a symptom or two shy of the number required for a hypomanic episode (elevated mood plus one or two of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode, or irritable mood plus two or three of the other symptoms of hypomania). The hypomanic and major depressive symptoms don\u2019t overlap, so you can\u2019t call it major depressive episode with mixed features. Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode. Here you\u2019d classify (no surprise) someone who has had an episode of hypomania but who hasn\u2019t ever fully met criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode. Short- duration cyclothymia. In a period less than 2 years (less than 12 months for a child or adolescent), such a patient will have had multiple episodes of both hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms, all of which will have been either too brief or have too few symptoms to qualify for a major depressive or hypomanic episode. Of course, there will be no manias and no symptoms of psychosis. Patients with short- duration cyclothymia will have symptoms for a majority of days and will have no symptom-free periods longer than 2 months. note that DSM-5 cautions us not to use just other specified bipolar disorder or other speci- fied depressive disorder as the actual diagnosis. Rather, we are also supposed to state, in full, one of the many (often cumbersome) titles given in the bipolar list just above and the depressive list below. One thing is certain: Regardless of which of the several discrete terms we choose, there is just one code number for each of these two categories of uncer- tainty.

F31.9 [296.80] Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder And here you\u2019d include patients for whom you don\u2019t care to indicate the reason you aren\u2019t diagnosing a well- defined bipolar condition. F32.8 [311] Other Specified Depressive Disorder Use other specified depressive disorder in the same way as described above for other specified bipolar and related disorder. DSM-5 provides the following examples of other specified depressive disorder: Recurrent brief depression. Every month for 12+ months, lasting from 2 to 13 days at a time, these patients have low mood plus at least four other symptoms of Other Specified Depressive Disorder 169 depression that aren\u2019t associated with menstruation. The patients have never ful - filled criteria for another mood disorder, and they\u2019ve not been psychotic. Short- duration depressive episode. These patients would meet criteria for major depressive episode except for duration\u2014their episodes last 4\u201313 days. Here\u2019s the full run-down: depressed mood; at least four other major depressive symptoms; clinically significant distress or impairment; have never met criteria for other mood disorders; not currently psychotic; and don\u2019t meet criteria for other conditions. Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms. These patients would meet cri - teria (duration, distress) for major depression, except that they have too few symp- toms. They don\u2019t have another psychotic or mood disorder. F32.9 [311] Unspecified Depressive Disorder As for unspecified bipolar and related disorder, when you don\u2019t care to indicate the reason for a more secure diagnosis, you can use the unspecified depressive disorder category. The advantage: mood disorders \u201cof uncertain etiology\u201d have been used so often in the past as to undermine their value. Whenever we clinicians encounter a patient with schizophrenia and postpsychotic depres- sive disorder, or one with a major depressive episode superimposed on a psychosis, we should think extra carefully about the diagnosis. Likewise, the occurrence of a manic epi- sode in a patient who was formerly diagnosed as psychotic should cause us to wonder whether the original diagnosis was correct. In both cases, some of these patients may actually have bipolar I disorder, and not schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder at all. This would appear to be an ongoing problem, regardless of which edition of the DSM we are using. 170 MOOD DISOrDErS 171",

As usual, the page number following each item indicates where a more detailed discussion begins. Primary Anxiety Disorders Panic disorder. These patients experience repeated panic attacks\u2014brief episodes of intense dread accompanied by a variety of physical and other symptoms, together with worry about having additional attacks and other related mental and behavioral changes (p. 176). Agoraphobia. Patients with this condition fear situations or places such as entering a store, where they might have trouble obtaining help if they became anxious (p. 179). Specific phobia . In this condition, patients fear specific objects or situations. Examples include animals; storms; heights; blood; airplanes; being closed in; or any situation that may lead to vomiting, choking, or developing an illness (p. 182). Social anxiety disorder. These patients imagine themselves embarrassed when they speak, write, or eat in public or use a public urinal (p. 185). Selective mutism. A child elects not to talk, except when alone or with select intimates (p. 187). Generalized anxiety disorder. Although they experience no episodes of acute panic, these patients feel tense or anxious much of the time and worry about many different issues (p. 191). Separation anxiety disorder. The patient becomes anxious when separated from a parent or other attachment figure (p. 188). Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition . Panic attacks and generalized anxiety symptoms can be caused by numerous medical conditions (p. 195). Substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder . Use of a substance or medication has caused panic attacks or other anxiety symptoms (p. 193). Other specified, or unspecified, anxiety disorder . Use these categories for disorders with prominent anxiety symptoms that don\u2019t fit neatly into any of the groups above (p. 198).

These patients are bothered by repeated thoughts or behaviors that can appear senseless, even to them (p. 200). Posttraumatic stress disorder. A severely traumatic event, such as combat or a natural disas- ter, is relived over and over (p. 219). Acute stress disorder. This condition is much like posttraumatic stress disorder, except that it begins during or immediately after the stressful event and lasts a month or less (p. 224). Avoidant personality disorder. These timid people are so easily wounded by criticism that they hesitate to become involved with others (p. 553). With anxious distress specifier for major depressive disorder. Some patients with major depressive disorder have much accompanying tension and anxiety (p. 159). Somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder. Panic and other anxiety symptoms are often part of somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder (pp. 251 and 260). Introduction The conditions discussed in this chapter are characterized by anxiety and the behaviors by which people try to ward it off. Panic disorder, the various phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder are collectively among the most frequently encountered of all mental disorders listed in DSM-5. Yet, in discussing them, we must also keep in mind three other facts about anxiety. The first of these is that a certain amount of anxiety isn\u2019t just normal, but adaptive and perhaps vital for our well-being and normal functioning. For example, when we are about to take an examination or speak in public (or write a book), the fear of failure spurs us on to adequate preparation. Similarly, normal fear lies behind our healthy regard for excessive debt, violent criminals, and poison ivy. Anxiety is also a symptom\u2014one that\u2019s encountered in many, perhaps most, mental disorders. Because it is so dramatic, we sometimes focus our attention on the anxiety 172 ANXIETY DISO rDErS to the exclusion of historical data and other symptoms (depression, substance use, and problems with memory, to name just a few) that are crucial to diagnosis. I\u2019ve inter - viewed countless patients whose anxiety symptoms have masked mood, somatic symp- tom, or other disorders\u2014 conditions that are often not only highly treatable when they are recognized, but deadly when they are not.

    "to diagnosis. I\u2019ve inter - viewed countless patients whose anxiety symptoms have masked mood, somatic symp- tom, or other disorders\u2014 conditions that are often not only highly treatable when they are recognized, but deadly when they are not. The third issue I want to emphasize is that anxiety symptoms can sometimes indi- cate the presence of a substance use problem, another medical condition, or even a different mental disorder altogether (such as a mood, somatic symptom, cognitive, or substance- related disorder). These conditions should be considered for any patient who presents with anxiety or avoidance behavior. Once again, I\u2019ve eschewed DSM-5\u2019s organization, which seems to rely on the typi- cal age of onset (most anxiety disorders begin when the patient is relatively young). Rather, I\u2019ve started with panic attacks, because they are pervasive throughout the anxi- ety (and many other) disorders. Panic Attack Someone in the throes of a panic attack feels foreboding\u2014a sense of disaster that is usually accompanied by cardiac symptoms (such as irregular or rapid heartbeat) and trouble breathing (shortness of breath, chest pain). The attack usually begins abruptly and builds rapidly to a peak; the whole, miserable experience usually lasts less than half an hour. Here are several important facts about panic attacks: \u2022\u2022 They are common (perhaps 30% of all adults have experienced at least one). In a 12-month period, over 10% of Americans will have one (though they are appar- ently about a third as common among Europeans). \u2022\u2022 Women are more often affected than men. \u2022\u2022 They can occur as isolated experiences in normal adults; in such cases, there is no diagnosis at all. \u2022\u2022 Panic attacks may occur within a broad spectrum of frequency, from just a few episodes in the lifetime of some individuals to many times per week in others. Some people even awaken at night with nocturnal attacks. \u2022\u2022 Untreated, they can be severely debilitating. Many patients change their behav- ior in reaction to the fear that the attacks mean they are psychotic or physically ill. \u2022\u2022 Treatment is sometimes easy, perhaps just by providing a little reassurance or a paper bag to breathe into. \u2022\u2022 But sometimes panic attacks mask other illnesses that range from mood disor - ders to heart attacks. Panic Attack 173 \u2022\u2022 Some panic attacks are triggered by specific situations, such as crossing a bridge or roaming a crowded supermarket. Such attacks are said",
    "a paper bag to breathe into. \u2022\u2022 But sometimes panic attacks mask other illnesses that range from mood disor - ders to heart attacks. Panic Attack 173 \u2022\u2022 Some panic attacks are triggered by specific situations, such as crossing a bridge or roaming a crowded supermarket. Such attacks are said to be cued or situ - ationally bound . Others have no relationship to a specific stimulus but arise spontaneously, as in panic disorder. These are termed unexpected or uncued . A third type, situationally predisposed attacks, consists of attacks in which the patient often (but not invariably) becomes panic- stricken when confronted by the stimulus. \u2022\u2022 The patient can be calm or anxious when the upswing in panic symptoms begins. \u2022\u2022 By themselves, panic attacks are not codable. The criteria are given so that they can be identified and applied as a specifier to whatever disorder may be appro - priate. Of course, they always occur in panic disorder, but there you don\u2019t have to specify them: they go with the territory. Pathological panic attacks usually begin in a person\u2019s 20s. Panic attacks may occur without other symptoms (when they may qualify for a diagnosis of panic disorder) or in connection with a variety of other disorders, which may include agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mood disor - ders, and psychotic disorders. They can also feature in anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and in substance- induced anxiety disorder. Essential Features of Panic Attack A panic attack is fear, sometimes stark terror, that begins suddenly and is accompa- nied by a variety of classic \u201cfight-or- flight\u201d symptoms, plus a few others\u2014chest pain, chills, feeling too hot, choking, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, tin- gling or numbness, excessive perspiration, nausea, dizziness, and tremor. As a result, these people may feel unreal or be afraid that they are losing their minds or dying. At least four of the somatic sensations are required. Coding Notes Panic attack is not a codable disorder. It provides the basis for panic disorder, and it can be attached as a specifier to other diagnoses. These include posttraumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders, and other mental disorders (including eating, mood, psychotic, personality, and substance use disorders). They are even found in medical conditions affecting the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Shorty Rheinbold Seated in the clinician\u2019s waiting room, Shorty",

They are even found in medical conditions affecting the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Shorty Rheinbold Seated in the clinician\u2019s waiting room, Shorty Rheinbold should have been relaxed. The lighting was soft, the music soothing; the sofa on which he was sitting was com - 174 ANXIETY DISO rDErS fortably upholstered. Angel fish swam lazily in their sparkling glass tank. But Shorty felt anything but calm. Perhaps it was the receptionist\u2014he wondered whether she was competent to handle an emergency with his sort of problem. She looked something like a badger, holed up behind her computer. For several minutes he had been feeling worse with every heartbeat. His heart was the key. When Shorty first sat down, he hadn\u2019t even noticed it, qui- etly ticking away, just doing its job inside his chest. But then, without any warning, it had begun to demand his attention. At first it had only skipped a beat or two, but after a minute, it had begun a ferocious assault on the inside of his chest wall. Every beat had become a painful, bruising thump that caused him to clutch at his chest. He tried to keep his hands under his jacket so as not to attract too much attention. The pounding heart and chest pain could mean only one thing\u2014after 2 months of attacks every few days, Shorty was beginning to get the message. Then, right on sched- ule, the shortness of breath began. It seemed to arise from his left chest area, where his heart was doing all the damage. It clawed its way up through his lungs and into his throat, gripping him around the neck so he could breathe only in the briefest of gulps. He was dying! Of course, the cardiologist Shorty consulted the week before had assured him that his heart was as sound as a brass bell, but this time he knew it was about to fail. He couldn\u2019t fathom why he hadn\u2019t died before; he had feared it with every attack. Now it seemed impossible that he would survive this one. Did he even want to? That thought made him suddenly want to retch. Shorty leaned forward so he could grip both his chest and his abdomen as unob -",
    "he hadn\u2019t died before; he had feared it with every attack. Now it seemed impossible that he would survive this one. Did he even want to? That thought made him suddenly want to retch. Shorty leaned forward so he could grip both his chest and his abdomen as unob - trusively as possible. He could hardly hold anything at all: The familiar tingling and numbness had started up in his fingers, and he could sense the shaking of his hands as they tried to contain the various miseries that had taken over his body. He glanced across the room to see whether Miss Badger had noticed. No help was coming from that quarter; she was still pounding away at her keyboard. Perhaps all the patients behaved this way. Perhaps\u2014 suddenly, there was an observer. Shorty was watching himself! Some part of him had floated free and seemed to hang suspended, halfway up the wall. From this vantage point, he could look down and view with pity and scorn the quivering flesh that was, or had been, Shorty Rheinbold. Now the Spirit Shorty saw that Shorty\u2019s face had become fiery red. Hot air had filled his head, which seemed to expand with every gasp. He floated farther up the wall and the ceiling melted away; he soared out into the brilliant sunshine. He squeezed his eyes shut but could not keep out the blinding light. Depression is so often found in patients who complain of recurrent panic attacks that the association cannot be overemphasized. Some studies suggest that over half the patients with panic disorder also have major depressive disorder. clearly, we must carefully evalu- ate for symptoms of a mood disorder everyone who presents with panic symptoms. Panic Attack 175 Evaluation of Shorty Rheinbold Shorty\u2019s panic attack was typical: It began suddenly, developed rapidly, and included a generous helping of the required symptoms. His shortness of breath (criterion A4) and heart palpitations (A1) are classical panic attack symptoms; he also had chest pain (A6), lightheadedness (A8), and numbness in his fingers (A10). Shorty\u2019s fear that he would die (A13) is typical of the fears that patients have during an attack. The sensation of watch- ing himself (depersonalization\u2014A11) is a less common symptom of panic. He needed only four of these symptoms to substantiate the fact of panic attack. Shorty\u2019s panic attack was uncued, which means that it seemed to happen",
    "typical of the fears that patients have during an attack. The sensation of watch- ing himself (depersonalization\u2014A11) is a less common symptom of panic. He needed only four of these symptoms to substantiate the fact of panic attack. Shorty\u2019s panic attack was uncued, which means that it seemed to happen spontane- ously, without provocation. He was unaware of any event, object, or thought that trig - gered it. Uncued attacks are typical of panic disorder, which can also include cued (or situationally bound) attacks. The panic attacks that develop in social anxiety disorder and specific phobia are cued to the stimuli that repeatedly and predictably pull the trigger. Panic attacks can occur in several medical conditions. One of these is acute myo- cardial infarction, the very condition many panic patients fear the most. Of course, when indicated patients with symptoms like Shorty\u2019s should be evaluated for myocar - dial infarction and other medical disorders. These include low blood sugar, irregu - lar heartbeat, mitral valve prolapse, temporal lobe epilepsy, and a rare adrenal gland tumor called a pheochromocytoma. Panic attacks also occur during intoxication with several psychoactive substances, including amphetamines, marijuana, and caffeine . (Note that in addition, some patients misuse alcohol or sedative drugs in an effort to reduce the severity of their panic attacks.) There is no code number associated with panic attack. I\u2019ll give Shorty\u2019s complete diagnosis below. F41.0 [300.01] Panic Disorder Panic disorder is a common anxiety disorder in which the patient experiences unex- pected panic attacks (usually many, but always more than one) and worries about having another. Though the panic attacks are usually uncued, situationally predisposed attacks and cued/situationally bound attacks also occur (see definitions, above). A strong minor- ity will have nocturnal panic attacks as well as those that occur while awake. Perhaps half of patients with panic disorder also have symptoms of agoraphobia (see p. 179), though many do not. Panic disorder typically begins during the patient\u2019s early 20s. It is one of the most common anxiety disorders, found in 1\u20134% of the general adult population (10% is the approximate figure for panic attacks in general). It is especially common among women. 176 ANXIETY DISO rDErS Essential Features of Panic Disorder As a result of surprise panic attacks (see the preceding description), the patient fears that they will happen again or tries to avert further attacks by taking (ineffective) action, such as",

It is especially common among women. 176 ANXIETY DISO rDErS Essential Features of Panic Disorder As a result of surprise panic attacks (see the preceding description), the patient fears that they will happen again or tries to avert further attacks by taking (ineffective) action, such as abandoning an once-favored activities or avoiding places where attacks have occurred. The Fine Print Don\u2019t forget the D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (1+ months) \u2022 Distress or disability (as above) \u2022 Differ- ential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders, other anxiety disorders, mood and psychotic disorders, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder [OCD], PTSD, actual danger) Shorty Rheinbold Again Shorty opened his eyes to discover that he was lying on his back on the waiting room floor. Two people were bending over him. One was the receptionist. He didn\u2019t recog - nize the other, but he guessed it must be the mental health clinician who was supposed to interview him. \u201cI feel like you saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cNot really,\u201d the clinician replied. \u201cYou\u2019re just fine. Does this happen often?\u201d \u201cEvery 2 or 3 days now.\u201d Shorty cautiously sat up. After a moment or two, he allowed them to help him to his feet and into the inner office. Just when his problem had begun wasn\u2019t quite clear at first. Shorty was 24 and had spent 4 years in the Coast Guard. Since his discharge, he\u2019d knocked around a bit, and then moved in with his folks while he worked in construction. Six months ago, he\u2019d got- ten a job as cashier in a filling station. That was just fine, sitting in a glassed-in booth all day making change, running credit cards through the electronic scanner, and selling chewing gum. The wages weren\u2019t exciting, but he didn\u2019t have to pay rent. Even with eating out almost every eve- ning, Shorty still had enough at the end of the week to take his girl out on Saturday nights. Neither one of them drank or used drugs, so even that didn\u2019t set him too far back. The problem had begun the day after Shorty had been working for a couple of months, when the boss told him to go out on the wrecker with Bruce, one of the mechan- ics. They had stopped along the eastbound Interstate to pick up an old Buick Skylark with a blown head gasket. For some reason, they had trouble getting",
    "working for a couple of months, when the boss told him to go out on the wrecker with Bruce, one of the mechan- ics. They had stopped along the eastbound Interstate to pick up an old Buick Skylark with a blown head gasket. For some reason, they had trouble getting it into the sling. Shorty was on the traffic side of the truck, trying to manipulate the hoist in response to Bruce\u2019s shouted directions. Suddenly, a caravan of tractor- trailer trucks roared past. The noise and the blast of wind caught Shorty off guard. He spun around into the side of the wrecker, fell, and rolled to a stop, inches from huge tires rolling by. Shorty\u2019s color and heart rate had returned to normal. The remainder of his story was easy enough to tell. He continued to go out on the wrecker, even though he felt Panic Disorder 177 scared, near panic every time he did so. He\u2019d only go when Bruce was along, and he carefully avoided the traffic side of the vehicles. But that wasn\u2019t the worst of the problem\u2014he could always quit and get another job. Lately, Shorty had been having these attacks at other times, when he was least expect- ing them. Now nothing seemed to trigger the attacks; they just happened, though not when he was at home or in his glass cage at work. When he was shopping last week, he\u2019d had to abandon the cart full of groceries he was buying for his mother. Now he didn\u2019t even want to go to the movies with his girl. For the last few weeks he had suggested that they spend Saturday night at her place watching TV instead. She hadn\u2019t complained yet, but he knew it was only a matter of time. \u201cI have just about enough strength to tough it out through the work day,\u201d Shorty said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to get a handle on this thing. I\u2019m too young to spend the rest of my life like a hermit in a cave.\u201d Further Evaluation of Shorty Rheinbold The fact that Shorty experienced panic attacks has already been established. They were originally associated with the specific situation of working around the wrecker. For months now, they occurred every few days, usually catching him unaware (panic dis - order criterion A). Undoubtedly worried and concerned (B1), he had altered his activi- ties with his girlfriend",
    "attacks has already been established. They were originally associated with the specific situation of working around the wrecker. For months now, they occurred every few days, usually catching him unaware (panic dis - order criterion A). Undoubtedly worried and concerned (B1), he had altered his activi- ties with his girlfriend (B2). A number of medical conditions can cause panic attacks; however, a cardiologist had recently pronounced Shorty to be medically fit. Substance- induced anxiety disorder (C) is also eliminated by the history: Shorty didn\u2019t use drugs or alcohol. (However, watch out for patients who \u201cmedicate\u201d their panic attacks with drugs or alcohol.) With no other mental disorder more likely (D), his symptoms fully support a diagnosis of panic disorder. But wait, as they say, there\u2019s more, for which we\u2019ll have to consider the symptoms of agoraphobia. Recently, Shorty feared all sorts of other situations that involved being away from home\u2014 driving, shopping, even going to the movies (agoraphobia criterion A)\u2014which nearly always provoked panic (C). As a result, he either avoided the situa - tions or had to be accompanied by Bruce or by his girlfriend (D). Shorty\u2019s life space had already begun to contract as a result of his fears; without treatment, it would seem to be only a matter of time before he would have to quit his job and remain at home (G). These symptoms are typical; we won\u2019t quibble about the exact duration, because they are so severe (F). They\u2019ll fulfill the requirements for agoraphobia, provided that we can rule out other etiologies for his symptoms (H, I). Sure, we should ask to determine that driving him was the fear that help would be unavailable or that escape would be dif - ficult (B), but knowing Shorty, I\u2019m pretty sure of the answer. The diagnosis of specific phobia or social anxiety disorder would seem unlikely, because the focus of Shorty\u2019s anxiety was not a single issue (such as enclosed places) or a social situation. Patients with somatic symptom disorder also complain of anxiety symptoms (though they aren\u2019t a diagnostic feature), but this is an unlikely diagnosis for a physically healthy man. 178 ANXIETY DISO rDErS Although the vignette doesn\u2019t address this possibility, major depressive disorder is comorbid with panic disorder in half of the cases. The danger lies in the often dramatic anxiety symptoms overshadowing subtle depressive symptoms, so that the clinician overlooks them completely. When",
    "for a physically healthy man. 178 ANXIETY DISO rDErS Although the vignette doesn\u2019t address this possibility, major depressive disorder is comorbid with panic disorder in half of the cases. The danger lies in the often dramatic anxiety symptoms overshadowing subtle depressive symptoms, so that the clinician overlooks them completely. When the criteria for both an anxiety and a mood disorder are met, they should both be listed. Other anxiety disorders can be comorbid in panic disorder patients; these include generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Shorty\u2019s mood was anxious, not depressed or irritable. I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 61. His diagnosis would be as follows: F41.0 [300.01] Panic disorder F40.00 [300.22] Agoraphobia It can be really hard to differentiate panic disorder and agoraphobia from other anxiety disorders that involve avoidance (especially specific phobia and social anxiety disorder). The final decision often comes down to clinical judgment, though the following sorts of information can help: 1. How many panic attacks does the patient have, and what type are they (cued, uncued, situationally predisposed)? Uncued attacks suggest panic disorder; cued attacks suggest specific phobia or social anxiety disorder. ( but they can be intermixed.) 2. In how many situations do they occur? Limited situations suggest specific pho- bia or social anxiety disorder; attacks that occur in a variety of situations sug - gest panic disorder and agoraphobia. 3. Does the patient awaken at night with panic attacks? This is more typical of panic disorder. 4. What is the focus of the fear? If it is having a subsequent panic attack, panic disorder may be the correct diagnosis\u2014unless the panic attacks occur only when the patient is, say, riding in an airplane, in which case you might correctly diagnose specific phobia, situational type. 5. Does the patient constantly worry about having panic attacks, even when in no danger of facing a feared situation (such as riding in an elevator)? This would suggest panic disorder and agoraphobia. F40.00 [300.22] Agoraphobia The agora was the marketplace to ancient Greeks. In contemporary usage, agoraphobia refers to the fear some people have of any situation or place where escape seems dif - ficult or embarrassing, or where help might be unavailable if anxiety symptoms should occur. Open or public places such as theaters and crowded supermarkets qualify; so does travel from home. Persons with agoraphobia either avoid the feared place or situa- Agoraphobia 179 tion",

Open or public places such as theaters and crowded supermarkets qualify; so does travel from home. Persons with agoraphobia either avoid the feared place or situa- Agoraphobia 179 tion entirely, or, if they must confront it, suffer intense anxiety or require the presence of a companion. In any event, agoraphobia is a concept the Greeks didn\u2019t have a word for; it was first used in 1873. Agoraphobia usually involves such situations as being away from home; standing in a crowd; staying home alone; being on a bridge; or traveling by bus, car, or train. Ago - raphobia can develop rapidly, within just a few weeks, in the wake of a series of panic attacks (see p. 173), when fear of recurrent attacks causes the patient to avoid leaving home or participating in other activities. Some patients develop agoraphobia without any preceding panic attacks. In recent years, estimates of the prevalence of agoraphobia have risen to the neigh- borhood of 1\u20132%. As with panic disorder, women are more susceptible than men; the disorder usually begins in the teens or 20s, though some patients have their first symp- toms after the age of 40. Often panic attacks precede the onset of the agoraphobia. It is strongly heritable. Essential Features of Agoraphobia These patients almost invariably experience inordinate anxiety or dread when they have to be alone or away from home. Potentially, there\u2019s an abundance of oppor - tunity: riding a bus (or other mass transit), shopping, attending a theatrical enter - tainment. For some, it\u2019s as ordinary as walking through an open space (flea market, playground), being part of a crowd, or standing in a queue. When you explore their thinking, these people are afraid that escape would be impossible or that help (in the event of panic) unavailable. So they avoid such situations or confront them only with a trusted friend or, if all else fails, endure them with lots of suffering.

In fact, in those 6 years she\u2019d hardly been anywhere at all. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could go out by myself\u2014it\u2019s like entering a war zone. If someone\u2019s not with me, I can barely stand to go to doctor appointments and stuff like that. But I still feel awfully nervous.\u201d 180 ANXIETY DISO rDErS The nervousness Lucy complained of hadn\u2019t included actual panic attacks; she never felt that she couldn\u2019t breathe or was about to die. Rather, she experienced an intense motor agitation that had caused her to flee from shopping malls, supermar - kets, and movie theaters. Nor could she ride on public transportation; buses and trains both terrified her. She had the feeling, vague but always present, that something awful would happen there. Perhaps she would become so anxious that she would pass out or wet herself, and no one would be able to help her. She hadn\u2019t been alone in public since the week before her high school commencement. She had only been able to go up onto the platform to receive her diploma because she was with her best friend, who would know what to do if she needed help. Lucy had always been a timid, rather sensitive girl. The first week of kindergarten, she had cried each time her mother left her by herself at school. But her father had insisted that she \u201ctoughen up,\u201d and within a few weeks she had nearly forgotten her ter- ror. She\u2019d subsequently maintained a nearly perfect attendance record at school. Then, shortly after her 17th birthday, her father died of leukemia. Her terror of being away from home had begun within a few weeks of his funeral. To make ends meet, her mother had sold their house, and they had moved into a condominium across the street from the high school. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I got through my last year,\u201d Lucy explained.

To make ends meet, her mother had sold their house, and they had moved into a condominium across the street from the high school. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I got through my last year,\u201d Lucy explained. For several years, Lucy had kept house while her mother assembled circuit boards at an electronics firm outside town. Lucy was perfectly comfortable in that role, even though her mother was away for hours at a time. Her physical health had been good; she had never used drugs or alcohol; and she had never had depression, suicidal ideas, delusions, or hallucinations. But a year ago Lucy had developed insulin- dependent dia- betes, which required frequent trips to the doctor. She had tried to take the bus by herself, but after several failures\u2014 once, in the middle of traffic, she had forced the rear door open and sprinted for home\u2014she had given up. Now her mother was applying for disability assistance so that she could remain at home to provide the aid and attendance Lucy required. Evaluation of Lucy Gould Because of her fears, which were inordinate and out of proportion to the actual dan - ger (criterion E), Lucy avoided a variety of situations and places, including supermar - kets, malls, buses, and trains (A). If she did go, she required a companion (D). She couldn\u2019t state exactly what might happen\u2014only that it would be awful and embarrass- ing (she might even lose bladder control) and that help might not be available (B). It is not unusual that her symptoms only came to light when another problem (diabetes) prevented her from staying at home; diabetes itself isn\u2019t associated with agoraphobic fears (H). OK, you\u2019ll have to read between the lines of the vignette to verify criteria C (the situations almost always provoke anxiety) and G (the patient experiences clinically important distress or impairment). Lucy\u2019s symptoms were too varied for specific phobia or social anxiety disorder . Agoraphobia 181 (Note also that in agoraphobia, the perceived danger emanates from the environment; in social anxiety disorder, it comes from the relationship with other people.) Her problem wasn\u2019t that she feared being left alone, as would be the case with separation anxiety disorder (although when she was five she clearly had had elements of that diagnosis).

    "social anxiety disorder, it comes from the relationship with other people.) Her problem wasn\u2019t that she feared being left alone, as would be the case with separation anxiety disorder (although when she was five she clearly had had elements of that diagnosis). She hadn\u2019t had a major trauma, as would be the case in PTSD (the death of her father was traumatic, but her own symptoms didn\u2019t focus on reliving this experience). There is no indication that she had OCD. And so (finally!) we have disposed of criterion I. Agoraphobia can accompany a variety of diagnoses, the most important of which are mood disorders that involve major depressive episodes. However, Lucy denied hav- ing symptoms of depression, psychosis, and substance use. Although she had diabetes, it developed many years after her agoraphobia symptoms became apparent. Besides, it\u2019s hard to imagine a physiological connection between agoraphobia and diabetes, and her anxiety symptoms were far more extensive than the realistic concerns you\u2019d expect from the average diabetic individual. Because Lucy had never experienced a discrete panic attack, she would not meet the criteria for panic disorder in addition to her agoraphobia. By the way, the fact that she was housebound would net her a low GAF score (31). F40.00 [300.22] Agoraphobia E10.9 [250.01] Insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus Specific Phobia Patients with specific phobias have unwarranted fears of specific objects or situations. The best recognized are phobias of animals, blood, heights, travel by airplane, being closed in, and thunderstorms. The anxiety produced by exposure to one of these stimuli may take the form of a panic attack or of a more generalized sensation of anxiety, but it is always directed at something specific. (However, these patients can also worry about what they might do\u2014faint, panic, lose control\u2014if they have to confront whatever it is they are afraid of.) Generally, the closer they are to the feared stimulus (and the more difficult it would be to escape), the worse they feel. Patients usually have more than one specific phobia. A person who is about to face one of these feared activities or objects will immediately begin to feel nervous or panicky\u2014a condition known as anticipatory anxiety . The degree of discomfort is often mild, however, so most people do not seek professional help. When it causes a patient to avoid feared situations, anticipatory anxiety can be a major inconvenience; it can even interfere with",
    "immediately begin to feel nervous or panicky\u2014a condition known as anticipatory anxiety . The degree of discomfort is often mild, however, so most people do not seek professional help. When it causes a patient to avoid feared situations, anticipatory anxiety can be a major inconvenience; it can even interfere with working. Patients with specific phobias involving blood, injury, or injection often experience what is called a vasovagal response; this means that reduced heart rate and blood pressure actually do cause the patients to faint. In the general population, specific phobia is one of the most frequently reported anxiety disorders. Up to 10% of U.S. adults have suffered to some degree from one of these specific phobias. However, by no means would all of these people qualify for a DSM-5 diagnosis: The clinical significance of these reported fears is so hard to judge. 182 ANXIETY DISO rDErS Onset is usually in childhood or adolescence; animal phobias especially tend to begin early. Some begin after a traumatic event, such as being bitten by an animal. A situational fear (such as being closed in or traveling by air) is more likely than other types of specific phobia to have a comorbid disorder such as depression and substance misuse, though comorbidity with a wide range of mental disorders is the rule. Females outnumber males, perhaps by a 2:1 ratio. Essential Features of Specific Phobia A specific situation or thing habitually causes such immediate, inordinate (and unrea- sonable) dread or anxiety that the patient avoids it or endures it with much anxiety.

For the several years since she had retired from her job teaching horticulture in junior college, she had concentrated on her own garden. At the flower show the year before, her rhododendrons had won first prize. But 10 days earlier, her mother had died in Detroit, over halfway across the coun- try. She and her sister had been appointed co- executors. The estate was large, and she Specific Phobia 183 would have to make several trips to probate the will and dispose of the house. That meant flying, and this was why she had sought help from the mental health clinic. \u201cI can\u2019t fly!\u201d she had told the clinician. \u201cI haven\u2019t flown anywhere for 20 years.\u201d Esther had been reared during the Depression; as a child, she had never had the opportunity to fly. With five children of her own to care for on her husband\u2019s school - teacher pay, she hadn\u2019t traveled much as an adult, either. She had made a few short hops years ago, when two of her children were getting married in different cities. On one of those trips, her plane had circled the field for nearly an hour, trying to land in Omaha between thunderstorms. The ride was wretchedly bumpy; the plane was full; and many of the passengers were airsick, including the men seated on either side of her. There was no one to help\u2014the flight attendants had to remain strapped in their seats. She had kept her eyes closed and breathed through her handkerchief to try to filter out the odors that filled the cabin. They finally landed safely, but it was the last time Esther had ever been up in an airplane. \u201cI don\u2019t even like to go to the airport to meet someone,\u201d she reported. \u201cEven that makes me feel short of breath and kind of sick to my stomach.

Then I get sort of a dull pain in my chest and I start to shake\u2014I feel that I\u2019m about to die, or something else awful will happen. It all seems so silly.\u201d Esther really had no alternatives to flying. She couldn\u2019t stay in Detroit until all of the business had been taken care of; it would take months. The train didn\u2019t connect, and the bus was impossible. Evaluation of Esther Dugoni Esther\u2019s anxiety symptoms were cued by the prospect of airplane travel (criterion A); even going to the airport inevitably produced anxiety (B), and she had avoided plane travel for years (C, E). She recognized that this fear was unreasonable (\u201csilly\u201d), and it embarrassed her (D); it was about to interfere with how she conducted her personal business (F). Specific phobia is not usually associated with any general medical condition or substance- induced disorder. In response to delusions, patients with schizophrenia will sometimes avoid objects or situations (a telephone that is \u201cbugged,\u201d food that is \u201cpoisoned\u201d), but such patients do not have the required insight that their fears are unfounded. Of course, specific phobias must be differentiated from fears associated with other disorders (such as agoraphobia, OCD, PTSD, social anxiety disorder\u2014G). Esther\u2019s clinician should ask about possible comorbid diagnoses. Pending that, and with a GAF score of 75, her diagnosis would be as given below. (Esther had only one phobia, a situational one; the average is three, each of which would be listed on a separate line with its own number.)

For example, you wouldn\u2019t diagnose a snake phobia in a prisoner serving a life sentence\u2014under which circumstances confrontation with snakes and activity restriction as a result would be unlikely.

    "prisoner serving a life sentence\u2014under which circumstances confrontation with snakes and activity restriction as a result would be unlikely. F40.10 [300.23] Social Anxiety Disorder Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a fear of appearing clumsy, silly, or shameful. Patients dread social gaffes such as choking when eating in public, trembling when writing, or being unable to perform when speaking or playing a musical instrument. Using a public urinal will cause anxiety for some men. Fear of blushing affects especially women, who may not be able to put into words what\u2019s so terrible about turning red. Fear of further choking is often acquired after an episode of choking on food; it can occur any time from childhood to old age. Some patients fear (and avoid) multiple such public situa - tions. Many people, men and women, have noticeable physical symptoms with SAD: blushing, hoarseness, tremor, and perspiration. Such patients may have actual panic attacks. Children may express their anxiety by clinging, crying, freezing, shrinking back, throwing tantrums, or refusing to speak. Studies of general populations report a lifetime occurrence of SAD ranging from 4% to as high as 13%. However, if we consider only those patients who are truly incon- venienced by their symptoms, prevalence figures are probably lower. Whatever the actual figure, these findings contradict previous impressions that SAD is rare. Perhaps interviewers tend to overlook a common condition that patients silently endure. Though males outnumber females in treatment settings, women predominate in general popu- lation samples. Onset is typically in the middle teens. The symptoms of SAD overlap with those of avoidant personality disorder; the latter is more severe, but both begin early, tend to last for years, and have some commonalities in family history. Indeed, SAD is reported to have a genetic basis. Essential Features of Social Anxiety Disorder Inordinate anxiety is attached to circumstances where others could closely observe the patient\u2014public speaking or performing, eating or having a drink, writing, per - haps just speaking with another person. Because these activities almost always pro- voke disproportionate fear of embarrassment or social rejection, the patient avoids these situations or endures them with much anxiety.

The patient fears public speaking or performing, but not other situations. Valerie Tubbs \u201cIt starts right here, and then it spreads like wildfire. I mean, like real fire!\u201d Valerie Tubbs pointed to the right side of her neck, which she kept carefully concealed with a blue silk scarf. \u201cIt\u201d had been happening for almost 10 years, any time she was with peo- ple; it was worse if she was with a lot of people. Then she felt that everybody noticed. Although she had never tried, Valerie didn\u2019t think that her reaction was something she could control. She just blushed whenever she thought people were watching her. It had started during a high school speech class, when she had to give a talk. She had become confused about the difference between a polyp and a medusa, and one of the boys had commented on the red spot that had appeared on her neck. She had quickly flushed all over and had to sit down, to the general amusement of the class. \u201cHe said it looked like a bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d she said. Since then, Valerie had tried to avoid the potential embarrassment of saying anything to more than a handful of people. She had given up her dream of becoming a fashion buyer for a department store, because she couldn\u2019t tolerate the scrutiny the job would entail. Instead, for the last 5 years she had worked dressing mannequins for the same store. Valerie said that it seemed \u201cstupid\u201d to be so afraid. It wasn\u2019t just that she turned red; she turned beet-red. \u201cI can feel prickly little fingers of heat crawling out across my neck and up my cheek. My face feels like it\u2019s on fire, and my skin is being scraped with a rusty razor.\u201d Whenever she blushed, she didn\u2019t feel exactly panicky. It was a sense of anxiety and restlessness that made her wish her body belonged to someone else. Even the thought of meeting new people caused her to feel irritable",
    "on fire, and my skin is being scraped with a rusty razor.\u201d Whenever she blushed, she didn\u2019t feel exactly panicky. It was a sense of anxiety and restlessness that made her wish her body belonged to someone else. Even the thought of meeting new people caused her to feel irritable and keyed up. Evaluation of Valerie Tubbs For years, Valerie had feared being embarrassed by the blushing that occurred when - ever she spoke with other people (criteria A, B, C, and F in one sentence). Her fear was 186 ANXIETY DISO rDErS excessive (E), and she knew it\u2014though insight isn\u2019t required for the diagnosis. With her reluctance to speak publicly (and her scarf), she avoided exposure to scrutiny (D). Her anxiety also prevented her from working at the job she would have preferred (G). With no actual panic attacks, and in the absence of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substance- induced anxiety disorder (H), determining her dis- order would come down to the differential diagnosis of phobias (I). In the absence of a typical history, we can quickly dismiss specific phobia . People who have agoraphobia may avoid dining out because they fear the embarrassment of having a panic attack in a public restaurant. Then you would only diagnose SAD if it had been present prior to the onset of the agoraphobia and was unrelated to it. (Sometimes even clinicians who specialize in diagnosing and treating the anxiety disorders can have trouble deciding between these two diagnoses.) Patients with anorexia nervosa avoid eating, but the focus is on their weight, not on the embarrassment that might result from gagging or leaving food on their lips. It is important to differentiate SAD from the ordinary shyness that is so com - mon among children and other young people; this shows the value of the criterion that symptoms must be present for at least half a year, required by DSM-5 for adults as well as for children. Also keep in mind that many people worry about or feel uncomfortable with social activities such as speaking in public ( stage fright or microphone fright ). They should not receive this diagnosis unless it in some important way affects their working, social, or personal functioning. Social phobia (as SAD used to be called) is often associated with suicide attempts and mood disorders. Anyone with SAD may be at risk for",

Social phobia (as SAD used to be called) is often associated with suicide attempts and mood disorders. Anyone with SAD may be at risk for self- treatment with drugs or alcohol; Valerie\u2019s clinician should ask carefully about these conditions. SAD has ele- ments in common with avoidant personality disorder, which, often comorbid in these patients, may be a warranted diagnosis in a patient who is generally inhibited socially, is overly sensitive to criticism, and feels inadequate. Other mental disorders you might sometimes need to rule out\u2014no problem for Valerie\u2014would include panic disorder , separation anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and autism spectrum disor- der. Valerie\u2019s fears involved far more than performances, so the specifier wouldn\u2019t apply. With a GAF score of 61, her diagnosis would be as follows: F40.10 [300.23] Social anxiety disorder F94.0 [313.23] Selective Mutism Selective mutism denotes children who remain silent except when alone or with a small group of intimates. The disorder typically begins during preschool years (ages 2\u20134), after normal speech has developed. Such a child, who speaks appropriately at home among family members but becomes relatively silent when among strangers, may not attract clinical attention until formal schooling begins. Although often shy, most such children have normal intelligence and hearing. When they do speak, they tend to use Selective Mutism 187 normal articulation, sentence structure, and vocabulary. The condition often improves spontaneously within weeks or months, though no one knows how to identify such a patient in advance of improvement. Selective mutism is uncommon, with a prevalence of under 1 in 1,000; it appears to affect girls and boys about equally. Family history is often positive for social anxiety disorder and relatives with selective mutism. Comorbid conditions include other anxi- ety disorders (especially separation anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder). They do not tend to have externalizing disorders, such as oppositional defiant or conduct disorder. Essential Features of Selective Mutism Despite speaking normally at other times, the patient regularly doesn\u2019t speak in cer- tain situations where speech is expected, such as in class.

More recently, however, evidence has accumulated that the condition also affects adults. This can happen in two ways. Perhaps one-third of children with SepAD continue to have symptoms of the disorder well into their adult years. However, some patients develop symptoms de novo in their late teens or even later\u2014 sometimes even beginning in old age. SepAD has a lifetime prevalence of about 4% for children and 6% for adults; for adults, the 12-month prevalence is nearly 2%. It is more common in females than in males, though boys are more likely to be referred for treatment. In children, SepAD may begin with a precipitant such as moving to a new home or school, a medical procedure or serious physical diagnosis, or the loss of an important friend or pet (or a parent). Symptoms often show up as school refusal, but younger chil- dren may even show reluctance at being left with a sitter or at day care. Children may enlist physical complaints, imagined or otherwise, as justification for remaining home with parents. Adults, too, may fear that something horrible will happen to an important attach - 188 ANXIETY DISO rDErS ment figure\u2014 perhaps a spouse, or even a child. As a result, they are reluctant to leave home (or any place of safety); they may fear even sleeping alone, and they experience nightmares about separation. When apart from the principal attachment figure, they may need to telephone or otherwise touch base several times a day. Some may try to ensure safety by setting up a routine of following the other person. When the onset is early in childhood, this condition is likely to remit; with later onset, symptoms are more likely to continue into adulthood and to confer more severe disability (though the intensity may wax and wane). Children with SepAD tend to drift",

When the onset is early in childhood, this condition is likely to remit; with later onset, symptoms are more likely to continue into adulthood and to confer more severe disability (though the intensity may wax and wane). Children with SepAD tend to drift into subclinical forms or nonclinical status. Most adults and children also have other disorders (especially mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders), though SepAD is often the condition present the longest. Children with SepAD often have parents with an adult form of the same disorder, and, as with most anxiety disorders, there is a strong genetic component. Essential Features of Separation Anxiety Disorder Because they fear what might happen to a parent or someone else important in their lives, these patients resist being alone. They imagine that the parent will die or become lost (or that they will), so that even the thought of separation can cause anxiety, nightmares, or perhaps vomiting spells or other physical complaints. They are therefore reluctant to attend school, go out to work, or to sleep away from home\u2014 perhaps even in their own beds.

The only reason for her evaluation, she told the clinician, was that her mother and stepfather had just signed on to join the Peace Corps; she, Nadine, would be left behind. \u201cI just know I won\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d She sobbed into her Kleenex. Being alone had frightened Nadine from the time she was very small. She thought she could trace it back to her father\u2019s death: He was a mechanic who drove a racing car for fun until the weekend he encountered a wall at the far turn of their hometown track. Her mother\u2019s response was strangely stoic. \u201cI think I took on the job of grieving for both of us,\u201d Nadine commented. Within the year, her mother had remarried. Her first day of first grade, Nadine had been so fearful that her mother had stayed Separation Anxiety Disorder 189 in the classroom. \u201cI was afraid something terrible would happen",
    "I took on the job of grieving for both of us,\u201d Nadine commented. Within the year, her mother had remarried. Her first day of first grade, Nadine had been so fearful that her mother had stayed Separation Anxiety Disorder 189 in the classroom. \u201cI was afraid something terrible would happen to her too, and I wanted to be there, for safety.\u201d After several weeks, Natalie had been able to tolerate being left, but the following year, she threw up when Labor Day rolled around. After a few miserable weeks in second grade, she was withdrawn and home- schooled. In 10th grade, she was reading and doing math at 12th-grade level. \u201cBut my social- ization skills were near nil. I\u2019d never even been to a sleepover at another girl\u2019s house,\u201d she said. So her parents bribed her with a cell phone and a promise that she could call any time. By the time Nadine was in junior college\u2014hardly farther away than her high school\u2014she\u2019d negotiated for a smart phone with a GPS device; now she could track her mother\u2019s whereabouts to within a few feet. With that, she said, she could \u201croam comfortably, stores and whatnot, as long as I could check Mom\u2019s location whenever I wished.\u201d Once, when her battery died, she had suffered a panic attack. Nonetheless, she still didn\u2019t graduate from junior college, and after a semester she returned home to be with her mother. \u201cI know it seems weird,\u201d she told the interviewer, \u201cbut I always imagine that someday she won\u2019t come home to me. Just like Daddy.\u201d Evaluation of Nadine Mortimer From the time she started school (criterion B), Nadine had had clear symptoms of SepAD. She worried that harm might befall her mother and was severely distressed when they were separated; she\u2019d vomited at the mere prospect of a new school year (A). As a result, she had almost no friends and had never slept away from home (C). There was no sign of other disorders to exclude (D). Modified by her adult status, many of these same symptoms persisted\u2014panic symptoms when she couldn\u2019t keep close tabs on her mother, from whom she refused to live apart. She even retained the same fear of harm befalling her mother if they ever were separated. The prospect of her parents\u2019 leaving for a new career deeply affected her. Even if Nadine hadn\u2019t had symptoms as a child,",
    "close tabs on her mother, from whom she refused to live apart. She even retained the same fear of harm befalling her mother if they ever were separated. The prospect of her parents\u2019 leaving for a new career deeply affected her. Even if Nadine hadn\u2019t had symptoms as a child, her adult disorder was troubling enough to qualify for the diagnosis of SepAD. A significant problem remains in the differential diagnosis of SepAD: How does one distinguish it from agoraphobia? There is some overlap, but patients with SepAD are afraid of being away from a parent or other significant person, whereas the fear for a person with agoraphobia is of being in a place from which escape will be difficult. The mute testimony of her smart phone suggests that Nadine\u2019s anxiety was of the former type, not the latter. I would put her current GAF score at 45. F93.0 [309.21] Separation anxiety disorder The DSM-IV criteria for Sep aD employed a number of behaviors only appropriate to chil- dren; perhaps this explains why it wasn\u2019t recognized in adults earlier. Even now, panic symptoms may sometimes draw clinicians off the scent of adult SepaD. 190 ANXIETY DISO rDErS F41.1 [300.02] Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can be hard to diagnose. The symptoms are rela - tively unfocused; the nervousness is low-key and chronic; there are no panic attacks. Furthermore, it is, after all, just worry, and that\u2019s something that touches all of us. But there are differences. Ordinary worry is somehow less serious; we are able (well, most of the time) to put it aside and concentrate on other, more immediate issues. The worry of GAD often starts of its own accord, seemingly without cause. And GAD worry is at times hard to control. It carries with it a collection of physical symptoms that pile onto the sense of agitated restlessness in a cascade of misery. Although some patients with GAD may be able to state what it is that makes them nervous, others cannot. GAD worry is typically about far more issues (\u201ceverything\u201d) than objective facts can justify. The disorder typically begins at about 30 years of age; many patients with GAD have been symptomatic for years without coming to the atten- tion of a clinician. Perhaps this is because the degree of impairment in GAD is often not all that severe. Genetic factors play an important role",
    "The disorder typically begins at about 30 years of age; many patients with GAD have been symptomatic for years without coming to the atten- tion of a clinician. Perhaps this is because the degree of impairment in GAD is often not all that severe. Genetic factors play an important role in the development of GAD. It is found in up to 9% of the general adult population (lifetime risk), and, as with nearly every other anxiety disorder, females predominate. Essential Features of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Hard-to- control, excessive worrying about a variety of issues\u2014health, family prob - lems, money, school, work\u2014 results in physical and mental complaints: muscle ten - sion, restlessness, becoming easily tired and irritable, experiencing poor concentra - tion, and trouble with insomnia.

But recently he had felt that he was walking a tightrope. For the past year he had been the administra- tive assistant to the chief executive officer of a Fortune 500 company, where he had previously worked in product engineering. \u201cI took the job because it seemed a great way to move up the corporate ladder,\u201d he said, \u201cbut almost every day I have the feeling my foot\u2019s about to slip off the rung.\u201d Each of the company\u2019s six ambitious vice- presidents saw Bert as a personal pipe - Generalized Anxiety Disorder 191 line to the CEO. His boss was a hard- driving workaholic who constantly sparked ideas and wanted them implemented yesterday. Several times he had told Bert that he was pleased with his performance. In fact, Bert was doing the best job of any administrative assistant he had ever had, but that didn\u2019t seem to reassure Bert. \u201cI\u2019ve felt uptight just about every day since I started this job. My chief expects action and results. He has zero patience for thinking about how it should all fit together. Our vice- presidents all want to have their own way.

Our vice- presidents all want to have their own way. Several of them hint pretty broadly that if I don\u2019t help them, they\u2019ll put in a bad word with the boss. I\u2019m always looking over my shoulder.\u201d Bert had trouble concentrating at work; at night he was exhausted but had trouble getting to sleep. Once he did, he slept fitfully. He had become chronically irritable at home, yelling at his children for no reason. He had never had a panic attack, and he didn\u2019t think he was depressed. In fact, he still took a great deal of pleasure in the two activities he enjoyed most: Sunday afternoon football on TV and Saturday night lovemaking with his wife. But recently, she had offered to take the kids to her mother\u2019s for a few weeks, to relieve some of the pressure. This only resurrected some of his old concerns that he wasn\u2019t good enough for her\u2014that she might find someone else and leave him. Bert was slightly overweight and balding, and he looked apprehensive. He was carefully dressed and fidgeted a bit; his speech was clear, coherent, relevant, and spon- taneous. He denied having obsessions, compulsions, phobias, delusions, or hallucina - tions. On the MMSE, he scored a perfect 30. He said that his main problem\u2014his only problem\u2014was his nagging uneasiness. Valium made him drowsy. He had tried meditating, but it only allowed him to concentrate more effectively on his problems. For a few weeks he had tried having a cocktail before dinner; that had both relaxed him and prompted worries about alcohol- ism. Once or twice he even went with his brother-in-law to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. \u201cNow I\u2019ve decided to try dreading one day at a time.\u201d Evaluation of Bert Parmalee Bert worried about multiple aspects of his life (his job, being an alcoholic, losing his wife); each of these worries was excessive for the facts (criterion A). The excessiveness of his worries would differentiate them from the usual sort of anxiety that is not pathologi- cal. Despite repeated efforts (meditation, medication, reassurance), he had been unable to control these fears (B). In addition, he had at least four physical or mental symptoms (only three are required): trouble concentrating (C3), fatigue (C2), irritability",
    "would differentiate them from the usual sort of anxiety that is not pathologi- cal. Despite repeated efforts (meditation, medication, reassurance), he had been unable to control these fears (B). In addition, he had at least four physical or mental symptoms (only three are required): trouble concentrating (C3), fatigue (C2), irritability (C4), and sleep disturbance (C6). He had been having difficulty nearly every day for longer than the required 6 months (A). And his symptoms caused him considerable distress, per - haps even more than is usual for patients with GAD (D). One of the difficulties in diagnosing GAD is that so many other conditions must be excluded (E). A number of physical conditions can cause anxiety symptoms; a complete 192 ANXIETY DISO rDErS workup of Bert\u2019s anxiety would have to consider these possibilities. From the informa- tion contained in the vignette, a substance- induced anxiety disorder would appear unlikely. Anxiety symptoms can be found in nearly every category of mental disorder, including psychotic, mood (depressed or manic), eating, somatic symptom, and cogni- tive disorders. From Bert\u2019s history, none of these would seem remotely likely (F). For example, an adjustment disorder with anxiety would be eliminated because Bert\u2019s symptoms met the criteria for another mental disorder. It is important that the patient\u2019s worry and anxiety not focus solely on feature of another mental disorder, especially another anxiety disorder. For example, it shouldn\u2019t be \u201cmerely\u201d worry about weight gain in anorexia nervosa, about contamination (OCD), separation from attachment figures ( separation anxiety disorder ), public embarrass - ment (social anxiety disorder), or having physical symptoms (somatic symptom disor- der). Nevertheless, note that a patient can have GAD in the presence of another mental disorder\u2014most often, mood and other anxiety disorders\u2014 provided that the symptoms of GAD are independent of the other condition. GAD is one of those conditions that offers no specifiers, or even indicators of sever- ity, so Bert\u2019s diagnosis, other than a GAF score of 70, would be a plain vanilla: F41.1 [300.02] Generalized anxiety disorder It is reasonable to ask this question: Does diagnosing GaD in a depressed patient help with your evaluation? after all, the anxiety symptoms may disappear once the depression has been sufficiently treated.

The value, I suppose, is that flagging the anxiety symptoms gives a more complete picture of the patient\u2019s pathology. also, you may have to treat the anxiety symptoms independently later on. Substance/Medication- Induced Anxiety Disorder When the symptoms of anxiety or panic can be attributed to the use of a chemical sub- stance, make the diagnosis of substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder. It can occur during acute intoxication (or heavy use, as with caffeine) or during withdrawal (as with alcohol or sedatives), but the symptoms must be more severe that you\u2019d expect for ordinary intoxication or withdrawal, and they must be serious enough to warrant clinical attention. Many substances can produce anxiety symptoms, but those most commonly asso - ciated are marijuana, amphetamines, and caffeine. See Table 15.1 in Chapter 15 for a summary of the substances for which intoxication or withdrawal can be expected to create anxiety. If more than one substance is involved, you\u2019d code each separately. Quite frankly, these disorders are probably rare.

Alert, intelligent, and well informed, she cooperated fully in providing the following information. Bonita\u2019s parents both held graduate degrees and were well established in their pro- fessions. They lived in a well-to-do suburb of San Diego. Bonita was their oldest child and only daughter. Strictly reared in the Catholic faith, she hadn\u2019t been allowed to date until a year before.

    "suburb of San Diego. Bonita was their oldest child and only daughter. Strictly reared in the Catholic faith, she hadn\u2019t been allowed to date until a year before. Until sorority rush week, the only alcohol she had tasted had been Communion wine. By her account and that of her companions, she had been happy, healthy, and vivacious when she arrived on campus a fortnight earlier. Two weeks had made a remarkable difference. Bonita now sat huddled on the examination table, feet drawn up beneath her. With her arms wrapped around her knees, she trembled noticeably. Although it was only September, she wore a sweater and complained of feeling cold. She kept reaching for the emesis basin beside her, as though she might need it again. Her voice quavered as she said that nothing like this had ever happened to her before. \u201cI had some beer last week. It didn\u2019t bother me at all, except I had a headache the next morning.\u201d This evening there had been a \u201cbig sister, little sister\u201d party at the sorority Bonita 194 ANXIETY DISO rDErS had just pledged. She had drunk some beer, and that had prompted her to take a few hits from the marijuana cigarette they were passing around. The beer must have numbed her throat, because she had been able to draw the smoke deep into her lungs and hold it, the way her friends had showed her. For about 10 minutes Bonita hadn\u2019t noticed anything at all. Then her head began to feel tight, as though her hair was a wig that didn\u2019t fit right. Suddenly, when she tried to inhale, her chest \u201cscreamed in pain,\u201d and she became instantly aware that she was about to die. She tried to run, but her rubbery legs refused to support her. The other girls hadn\u2019t had much experience with drug reactions, but they called one of the men from the fraternity house next door, who came over and tried to talk Bonita down. After an hour, she still felt the panicked certainty that she would die or go mad. That was when they decided to bring her to the emergency room. At length she said, \u201cThey said it would relax me and expand my consciousness. I just want to contract it again.\u201d Evaluation of Bonita Ramirez Bonita\u2019s history\u2014she was healthy until the ingestion of a substance that is known to produce anxiety symptoms,",
    "decided to bring her to the emergency room. At length she said, \u201cThey said it would relax me and expand my consciousness. I just want to contract it again.\u201d Evaluation of Bonita Ramirez Bonita\u2019s history\u2014she was healthy until the ingestion of a substance that is known to produce anxiety symptoms, especially in a na\u00efve user\u2014is a dead giveaway for the diag- nosis (criteria A, B). Other drugs that commonly produce anxiety symptoms include amphetamines, which can also produce panic attack symptoms, and caffeine when used heavily. However, because anxiety symptoms can be encountered at some point during the use of most substances, you can code an anxiety disorder secondary to the use of nearly any of them, provided that the anxiety symptoms are worse than you would expect for ordinary substance withdrawal or intoxication. Because she required emergency evaluation and treatment, we would judge this to be the case for Bonita (E). Despite the proximity of the development of her symptoms to substance use (C), her clinician would want to be sure that she did not have another medical condition (or treatment with medication for a medical condition) that could also explain her anxiety symptoms. Although she was severely panicked when she arrived at the emergency room, I would score Bonita\u2019s GAF as a relatively high 80, because her symptoms had caused her no actual disability (plenty of distress) and should be transient; other diagnosticians might disagree. She had not used pot before, so she had no use disorder, and her code comes from the \u201cnone\u201d row for cannabis in Table 15.3. F12.980 [292.89] Cannabis- induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication F06.4 [293.84] Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Many medical disorders can produce anxiety symptoms, which will usually resemble those of panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Occasionally, they may take Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 195 the form of obsessions or compulsions. Most anxiety symptoms won\u2019t be caused by a medical disorder, but it is supremely important to identify those that are. The symp - toms of an untreated medical disorder can evolve from anxiety to permanent disability (consider the dangers of a growing brain tumor).

Millicent Worthy \u201cI wonder if we could just leave the door open.\u201d Millicent Worthy got up from the chair and opened the examining room door. She had fidgeted throughout the first part of the interview. Part of that time, she had hardly seemed to be paying attention at all. \u201cI feel better not being so closed in.\u201d Once she finally settled down, she told this story. Millicent was 24 and divorced. She had never touched drugs or alcohol. In fact, until about 4 months ago, she\u2019d been well all her life. She had visited a mental health clinic only once before, when she was 12: Her parents were having marital problems, and the entire family had gone for family counseling. She had first felt nervous while tending the checkout counter at the video rental outlet where she worked. She felt cramped, hemmed in, as if she needed to walk around. One afternoon, when she was the only employee in the store and she had to stay behind the counter, her heart began to pound and she perspired and became short of breath. She thought she was about to die. Over the next several weeks, Millicent gradually became aware of other symp - toms. Her hand had begun to shake; she noticed it one day at the end of her shift when she was adding up the receipts from her cash register. Her appetite was voracious, yet 196 ANXIETY DISO rDErS in the past 6 weeks her weight had dropped nearly 10 pounds. She still loved watching movies, but lately she felt so tired at night that she could barely keep awake in front of the TV.

    "her weight had dropped nearly 10 pounds. She still loved watching movies, but lately she felt so tired at night that she could barely keep awake in front of the TV. Her mood had been somewhat irritable. \u201cAs I thought about it, I realized that all this started about the time my boyfriend and I decided to get married. We\u2019ve been living together for a year, and I really love him. But I\u2019d been burned before, in my first marriage. I thought that might be what was bothering me, so I gave back his ring and moved out. If anything, I feel worse now than before.\u201d Several times during the interview Millicent shifted restlessly in her chair. Her speech was rapid, though she could be interrupted. Her eyes seemed to protrude slightly, and although she had lost weight, a fullness in her neck suggested a goiter. She admitted that she was having trouble tolerating heat. \u201cThere\u2019s no air conditioner in our store. Last summer it was no problem\u2014we kept the door open. But now it\u2019s terrible! And if I wore any less clothing to work, they\u2019d have to give me a desk in the adult video section.\u201d Millicent\u2019s thyroid function studies proved to be markedly abnormal. Within 2 months an endocrinologist had brought her hyperactive thyroid under control, and her anxiety symptoms had disappeared completely. Six months later, she and her fianc\u00e9 were married. Evaluation of Millicent Worthy Millicent had at least one panic attack (criterion A); her distress was palpable (E). The only remaining requirements would involve ruling out other causes of her problem. If she had had repeated panic attacks and if the symptoms of her goiter had been overlooked, she could have been misdiagnosed as having panic disorder . Her rest - lessness could have been misinterpreted as generalized anxiety disorder; her feelings of being closed in sound like a specific phobia . (Even Millicent interpreted her own symptoms as psychological, C.) Such scenarios reinforce the wisdom of placing physical conditions at the top of the list of differential diagnoses. Irritability, restless hyperactivity, and weight loss also suggest a manic episode , but these are usually accompanied by a subjective feeling of high energy, not fatigue. Millicent\u2019s rapid speech could be interrupted; in bipolar mania, often it cannot. Her lack of previous depressions or manias would also militate against any mood disorders.

Her history rules out a substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder. And her atten- tion span and orientation were good, so that we can disregard delirium (D). Finally, we know that the physiological effects of hyperthyroidism can cause anxiety symptoms of the sort Millicent experienced (B). The broken engagement was noted not because it seemed a cause of her anxiety symptoms, but because her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 was a problem that should be addressed as part of the overall treatment plan. I\u2019d put her GAF score at an almost- healthy, but still-needs-to-be- addressed 85.

Use one of these categories to code disorders with prominent anxiety symptoms that do not fit neatly into any of the groups above (p. 216). Introduction This chapter\u2014new to the DSMs\u2014pulls together disorders that have in common intrusive thoughts and time- consuming, repetitive behaviors: skin picking, hoarding, checking for body defects, and of course the classic component symptoms of obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder (OCD). These behaviors aren\u2019t all unwanted\u2014at least not at first, as with the pursuit of physical perfection (body dysmorphic disorder) or an accumu - lation of goods (hoarding). However they begin, the behaviors eventually become symptoms\u2014 burdensome to those whose once voluntary acts have morphed into duties that are performed at the cost of anxiety and distress. A number of other features bind together this seemingly disparate collection of conditions: onset when young, similar comorbidity, a family history of OCD, similar treatment response, and hints of dysfunction in the frontostriatal brain circuitry (cau - date hyperactivity). F42 [300.3] Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive Disorder Obsessions are recurring thoughts, beliefs, or ideas that dominate a person\u2019s mental content. They persist despite the fact that the person may believe they are unrealistic and tries to resist them. Compulsions are acts (either physical or mental) performed repeatedly in a way that the person may realize is neither appropriate nor useful. So why do them? For the most part, the aim is to neutralize the obsessional thinking. Note, then, that repeated thoughts can themselves sometimes be compulsions, if their purpose is to reduce the obsessional anxiety. Compulsions can be comparatively simple, such as uttering or thinking a word or phrase of protection against an obsessive thought. But some are almost",
    "aim is to neutralize the obsessional thinking. Note, then, that repeated thoughts can themselves sometimes be compulsions, if their purpose is to reduce the obsessional anxiety. Compulsions can be comparatively simple, such as uttering or thinking a word or phrase of protection against an obsessive thought. But some are almost unbelievably complex. For instance, some elaborate dressing, bedtime, or washing rituals, if not per- formed exactly as specified by intricate rules, must be repeated until the patient gets it right. Of course, that sort of behavior can soak up hours every day. Most patients have both obsessions and compulsions, which usually result in anxi- ety and dread. And most patients recognize them as being irrational and want to resist. OCD comprises four major symptom patterns, whose features sometimes overlap. \u2022\u2022 The most common is a fear of contamination that leads to excessive handwash - ing. \u2022\u2022 Doubts (\u201cDid I turn off the cooktop?\u201d) lead to excessive checking: The patient returns repeatedly to be sure that the cooktop is well and truly cold. \u2022\u2022 Obsessions without compulsions constitute a less common pattern. \u2022\u2022 Obsessions and compulsions slow some patients down to the point that it can take them hours just to finish breakfast or other daily routines. 200 OBSESSIVE\u2013COMPULSIVE AND rELATED DISO rDErS Obsessions about symmetry (putting things into a specific order, counting things) and forbidden thoughts (sacrilegious ideas, sexual taboos) also commonly occur. One feature that helps classify patients with OCD is their degree of insight. Most patients are pretty well aware that their behavior is odd or peculiar; in fact, they are often embarrassed by it and try to hide it. But others\u2014 perhaps 10\u201325% of all patients with OCD\u2014either have never recognized the irrationality of their behavior or have now to some degree lost that insight. Poor insight often indicates a worse prognosis. A few patients have so little that they are actually delusional; however, their OCD can be distinguished from delusional disorder by the presence of their obsessions (you don\u2019t need to give them an additional psychotic diagnosis). Note that children often don\u2019t have the experience to judge the reasonableness of their own behavior; therefore, insight specifiers often don\u2019t apply to them. OCD is clinically important because it is usually chronic and often debilitating. Though symptoms may wax and wane, it puts patients at risk for celibacy or marital dis- cord and interferes with performance at school",
    "judge the reasonableness of their own behavior; therefore, insight specifiers often don\u2019t apply to them. OCD is clinically important because it is usually chronic and often debilitating. Though symptoms may wax and wane, it puts patients at risk for celibacy or marital dis- cord and interferes with performance at school and work. Comorbidity is the rule, with two- thirds of patients experiencing major depression. Perhaps 15% attempt suicide. Men and women are about equally likely to be affected by OCD. Its prevalence, which may be as high as 2% in the general population, is reported to be greater in higher socioeconomic classes and in individuals of high intelligence. OCD is strongly familial (risk for first- degree relatives is 12%, about six times normal) and probably at least in part inherited. However, it is still unclear how genetics and environmental influences interact. OCD typically begins in adolescence (males) or young adult life (females), but it often takes a decade or more before patients come to clinical attention. When it begins before puberty, compulsions may start first, often accompanied by tics and comorbid disorders. Tic Specifier DSM-5 has added a new specifier concerning a patient\u2019s experience with chronic (but not transient) tic disorder. These patients, usually male, tend to have a very early onset of OCD\u2014often before the age of 11. They are especially likely to obsess over issues of exactness and symmetry; their compulsions concern ordering and arranging things. Some studies seem to suggest that a chronic tic disorder may reduce patients\u2019 response to antidepressant medications (though not to cognitive- behavioral therapy), and that antipsychotic drugs may help. However, it isn\u2019t clear that the history of tics denotes a patient who is more seriously ill. The tic specifier will apply to about a fourth of patients with OCD. The December 2008 issue of The Atlantic reported asking for a term that would describe the irresistible impulse to rearrange that which someone else has already loaded into a dishwasher. numerous readers suggested \u201cobsessive compulsive dishorder.\u201d Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive Disorder 201 Essential Features of Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive Disorder The patient has distressing obsessions or compulsions (or both!) that occupy so much time they interfere with accustomed routines.

Compulsions are repeated physical (sometimes mental) behaviors that follow rules (or respond to obsessions) in an attempt to alleviate distress; the patient may try to resist them.

Leighton Prescott Pausing for a moment, Leighton Prescott leaned forward to straighten a stack of jour - nals on the interviewer\u2019s desk. The chapped skin on the backs of his hands was the color of dusty bricks. Apparently satisfied, he resumed his narrative. \u201cI would get this feeling that there could be semen on my hands and that it might be transferred to a woman and get her pregnant, even if I only shook hands with her. So I started washing extra carefully each time I masturbated.\u201d Leighton was a 23-year-old graduate student in plant physiology. Though he was enormously bright and dedicated to science, his grades had slipped badly over the past few months. He attributed this to the handwashing rituals. Whenever he had the 202 OBSESSIVE\u2013COMPULSIVE AND rELATED DISO rDErS thought that he might have contaminated his hands with semen, he felt compelled to scrub them vigorously. A year earlier, this had only meant 3 or 4 minutes with a bar of soap and water as hot as he could stand it. Soon he required a nail brush; still later he was brushing his hands and wrists as well.

    "compelled to scrub them vigorously. A year earlier, this had only meant 3 or 4 minutes with a bar of soap and water as hot as he could stand it. Soon he required a nail brush; still later he was brushing his hands and wrists as well. Now an elaborate ritual had evolved. First he scraped under his nails with a blade; then he used the brush on them. He then lathered surgical soap up to his elbows and scrubbed with a different brush for 15 minutes per arm. Then he would have to start over with his nails, because semen he had scrubbed off his arms might have lodged under them. If he had the thought that he had not performed one of the steps exactly right, he would have to start all over again. In recent weeks this had become the norm. \u201cI know it seems crazy,\u201d he said with a glance at his hands. \u201cI\u2019m a biologist. That part of me knows that spermatozoa can\u2019t live longer than a few minutes on the skin. But if I don\u2019t wash, the pressure just builds up and up, until I have to wash\u2014 washing is the only thing that relieves the anxiety.\u201d Leighton didn\u2019t think he was depressed, though he was appropriately concerned about his symptoms. His sleep and appetite had been normal; he had never felt guilty or suicidal. \u201cJust stupid, especially when my girl stopped seeing me. I used the bathroom in a restaurant where I took her to eat. After 45 minutes, she had to send the manager in for me.\u201d He laughed without much humor. \u201cShe said she might see me again, if I\u2019d clean up my act.\u201d Evaluation of Leighton Prescott Leighton\u2019s obsessions and compulsions (criterion A) both easily fulfilled the require - ments for OCD. He tried to suppress the recurrent thoughts about contamination, which he recognized were the unreasonable products of his own mind (good insight). He felt compelled to ward off these ideas by repetitive handwashing, which he acknowl- edged was grossly excessive. By the time he came for help, his symptoms occupied several hours each day, interfered with his schooling and social life, and caused him severe distress (B). He had no other identifiable mental disorder that might account for his symptoms (D). An important step in evaluating anyone for OCD is to determine whether the patient\u2019s focus of concern",
    "symptoms occupied several hours each day, interfered with his schooling and social life, and caused him severe distress (B). He had no other identifiable mental disorder that might account for his symptoms (D). An important step in evaluating anyone for OCD is to determine whether the patient\u2019s focus of concern is pathological. For example, someone who lives in a ghetto or a war zone might be prudent to triple-lock the doors and frequently check security. Had Leighton been excessively concerned about numerous real-life problems (such as pass- ing his exams or succeeding with his girlfriend), he might instead warrant a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Though repetitive behavior is also characteristic of Tourette\u2019s disorder and tem- poral lobe epilepsy, patients with other medical conditions rarely present with obses- sions or compulsions (C). However, occasionally a person will develop obsessions or compulsions as a result of substance use. Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive Disorder 203 Inquire carefully about past or present tics, reported in about one- quarter of all patients with OCD. Not only is there a relationship between OCD and Tourette\u2019s dis- order, but an outsized percentage of patients with OCD (though not Leighton) report a history of chronic tics. Obsessional thinking or compulsive behavior can be found in a variety of other mental disorders. People may obsessively pursue any number of activities, such as gam- bling, drinking, and sex. The differential diagnosis also includes body dysmorphic dis- order (the patient obsesses about body shape) and illness anxiety disorder (the focus is health). Patients with psychotic disorders sometimes maintain their obsessional ideas to a delusional degree. And of course there is something a bit obsessive in the eating behaviors of patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Perhaps 20% of patients with OCD have premorbid obsessional traits. Because of its name, obsessive\u2013 compulsive personality disorder (see p. 558) can be confused with OCD. Patients with only the personality disorder may not have obsessions or compulsions at all. They are perfectionistic and become preoccupied with rules, lists, and details. These people may accomplish tasks slowly because they keep checking to be sure it is being performed exactly right, but they do not have the desire to resist these behaviors. OCD and obsessive\u2013 compulsive personality disorder can coexist, in which case the OCD is often extra severe. Some clinicians believe that the border zone between OCD and schizotypal personality disorder is also a common problem",

OCD and obsessive\u2013 compulsive personality disorder can coexist, in which case the OCD is often extra severe. Some clinicians believe that the border zone between OCD and schizotypal personality disorder is also a common problem in dif- ferential diagnosis. Leighton\u2019s clinician needs to ensure that he doesn\u2019t have one of the (numerous) other conditions that often accompany OCD. Besides the two personality disorders just men- tioned, I\u2019d especially check for mood disorders (either depressive or bipolar) and anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Although most patients with OCD recognize that their obsessions and compul - sions are unreasonable or excessive, some lose insight as the illness wears on. Leighton recognized that he was being unreasonable; we\u2019ll code him accordingly. With a GAF score of 60, his diagnosis would be the following: F42 [300.3] Obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, with good insight as many as half of patients with O cD have an accompanying mood disorder. Some only show their obsessional symptoms when they are in the midst of a severe depression. Patients with OcD are also highly likely to have an accompanying anxiety disorder. (Indeed, OcD was itself classified as an anxiety disorder in earlier DSMs.) F45.22 [300.7] Body Dysmorphic Disorder Patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) worry that there is something wrong with the shape or appearance of a body part\u2014most often breasts, genitalia, hair, or the 204 OBSESSIVE\u2013COMPULSIVE AND rELATED DISO rDErS nose or some other portion of the face. The ideas these patients have about their bodies are not delusional; as in illness anxiety disorder, they are overvalued ideas. At one time the disorder was called dysmorphophobia ; although some clinicians may still call it that, it isn\u2019t a phobia at all (irrational fear doesn\u2019t really enter into it). This disorder can be devastating. Although they frequently request medical pro - cedures (such as dermabrasion) or plastic surgery to correct their imagined defects, patients are often dissatisfied with the results. For that reason, surgery is usually contraindicated in these patients. They may also seek reassurance (which helps only briefly), try to hide their perceived deformities with clothing or body hair, or avoid social situations; some even become housebound. The preoccupation causes clinically important distress of other sorts\u2014 depressed mood, for example, even suicide ideas and attempts. Insight varies, though",

The preoccupation causes clinically important distress of other sorts\u2014 depressed mood, for example, even suicide ideas and attempts. Insight varies, though it\u2019s mostly poor. In the general population, the rate of BDD is probably about 2%. It may account for as many as 10% of patients who consult a dermatologist and a third of patients seek- ing rhinoplasty. Though patients with BDD are relatively young (it tends to begin dur- ing the teen years), incidence may peak again after menopause. Although the question is not settled, men and women are probably about equally affected. However, males are more often concerned about genitals and hair. Essential Features of Body Dysmorphic Disorder In response to a miniscule, sometimes invisible physical flaw, the patient repeatedly checks in a mirror, asks for reassurance, or picks at patches of skin\u2014or makes mental comparisons with other people.

The patient thinks that the BDD concerns are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs. The patient strongly believes that the BDD concerns are true. Muscle Dysmorphia Specifier The muscle dysmorphia specifier for BDD is found almost exclusively in men. Such a man believes that he is too small or slightly built. As a result, he will often take dieting or weight lifting to extremes, and may misuse anabolic steroids or other drugs. (These patients may also be concerned about other body features\u2014skin, hair, or whatever.) Cecil Crane Cecil Crane was only 24 when he was referred. \u201cHe came in here last week asking for a rhinoplasty,\u201d said the plastic surgeon on the telephone, \u201cbut his nose looks perfect to me.

    "Cecil Crane was only 24 when he was referred. \u201cHe came in here last week asking for a rhinoplasty,\u201d said the plastic surgeon on the telephone, \u201cbut his nose looks perfect to me. I told him that, but he insisted there was something wrong with it. I\u2019ve seen this kind of patient before\u2014if I operate, they\u2019re never satisfied. It\u2019s a lawsuit waiting to hap- pen.\u201d When Cecil appeared a few days later, he had the most beautiful nose the clinician had ever seen, apart from one or two Greek statues. \u201cWhat seems to be wrong with it?\u201d \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d ask that,\u201d said Cecil. \u201cEverybody says that.\u201d \u201cBut you don\u2019t believe it?\u201d \u201cWell, they look at me funny. Even at work\u2014I sell suits at Macy\u2019s\u2014I sometimes feel that the customers notice. I think it\u2019s this bump here.\u201d Viewed from a certain angle, the area Cecil pointed out bore the barest suggestion of a convexity. He complained that it had cost him his girlfriend, who always said it looked fine to her. Weary of Cecil\u2019s trying to look at his profile in every mirror he passed and banging on about plastic surgery all the time, she\u2019d finally sought greener pastures. Cecil felt unhappy, though not depressed. He admitted that he was making a mess of his life, but he had nevertheless maintained his interests in reading and going to the movies. He thought his sex interest was good, though he\u2019d had no chance to test it since the departure of his girlfriend. His appetite was good, and his weight was about average for his height. His flow of thought was unremarkable; its content, aside from his concern for his nose, seemed quite ordinary. He even admitted that it was possible that his nose was less ugly than he feared, though he thought that unlikely. Cecil couldn\u2019t say exactly when his worry about his nose began. It may have been about the time he started shaving. He recalled frequently gazing at a silhouette of his profile that had been cut from black paper during a seashore vacation with his family. Although numerous relatives and friends had remarked that it was a good likeness, something about the nose had bothered him. One day he had taken it down from the wall and, with a pair of scissors, he\u2019d tried to put it to rights. Within moments the nose lay in snippets on",
    "numerous relatives and friends had remarked that it was a good likeness, something about the nose had bothered him. One day he had taken it down from the wall and, with a pair of scissors, he\u2019d tried to put it to rights. Within moments the nose lay in snippets on the kitchen table, and Cecil was grounded for a month. \u201cI sure hope the plastic surgeon is a better artist than I am,\u201d he commented. 206 OBSESSIVE\u2013COMPULSIVE AND rELATED DISO rDErS Evaluation of Cecil Crane The criteria for BDD are straightforward. Cecil was preoccupied with his flawless nose (criterion A), which caused him enough distress to seek surgery\u2014and lose his girl - friend (C). More than one person had tried to assure him that his nose was rather ordi- nary, so his distress evidently exceeded normal concerns regarding appearance. And he appeared to need the constant checking in the mirror (B). Despite the full range of symptoms, there are several disorders in the differential diagnosis to consider. In illness anxiety disorder, it isn\u2019t appearance that preoccupies the patient; rather, it is fear of having a disease. In anorexia nervosa , patients have distorted self-image, but only in the context of concern about overweight. In the somatic type of delusional disorder, patients lack insight that their complaints might be unreasonable, whereas Cecil was willing to entertain the notion that others might see his nose differently. (However, some patients with BDD completely lack insight; then the differentiation turns on the content of the delusion, which in delusional disorder will involve the func- tion of or sensations in body parts, not their appearance.) Complaints from patients with schizophrenia about appearance are often bizarre (one woman reported that when she looked into the mirror, she noticed that her head had been replaced by a mushroom). In gender dysphoria, patients\u2019 complaints are limited to the conviction that they should have been born the opposite sex. None of these was the focus of Cecil\u2019s concern (D, E). However, his clinician would do well to look carefully for social phobia, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder, all of which can be comorbid with body dysmorphic disor- der. Pending investigation for these disorders, Cecil\u2019s full diagnosis would be as given below, with a GAF score of 70: F45.22 [300.7] Body dysmorphic disorder, with fair insight F42 [300.3] Hoarding Disorder Over a thousand years ago, the Beowulf legend",

Pending investigation for these disorders, Cecil\u2019s full diagnosis would be as given below, with a GAF score of 70: F45.22 [300.7] Body dysmorphic disorder, with fair insight F42 [300.3] Hoarding Disorder Over a thousand years ago, the Beowulf legend referred to a hoard as a mass of some- thing valuable (especially money or other treasure) laid by for future use. Nowadays, we stand this definition on its head to mean worthless stuff that\u2019s kept beyond all practical use. The motivations behind hoarding can be varied. Some people believe their things are valuable when they\u2019re not. Others may be imitating behavior they\u2019ve encountered in family members (a genetic component is also suspected). Still others apparently feel comforted by the presence of things they\u2019ve grown used to having, or that they think they may need later. Whatever the instigation, a hoarder\u2019s living space becomes clut - tered, perhaps eventually filling up completely. (If living areas remain habitable, it\u2019s probably because someone else tidies up the mess.) One social consequence of hoarding is that children dread having visitors to the home; they sure don\u2019t learn the basics of housekeeping there! There are now online support groups for hoarders\u2019 children, who Hoarding Disorder 207 are otherwise left with their own hopeless attempts at coping with the unsanitary, the unsightly, and the unsafe. A condition that\u2019s said to affect 2\u20135% of the general population, hoarding disorder is new in DSM-5. It was once considered a possible variant of OCD, but in fact not even 20% of hoarders meet OCD criteria\u2014partly because they don\u2019t consider their symptoms to be intrusive, unpleasant, or distressing. Indeed, distress often develops only when they are forced to get rid of the stuff they\u2019ve so laboriously brought home. Hoarding disorder comprises several special types: people who hoard books, or animals (think a houseful of cats), or food that is\u2014ugh!\u2014way past its pull date. Animal hoarders also save other things, which may at least have the advantage of better sanita- tion. The disorder begins young and worsens with time, so that it is more often found among older adults; males may outnumber females. It appears to be strongly hereditary. Essential Features of Hoarding Disorder These patients are in the grip of something powerful: the overwhelming urge to accumulate stuff.

They experience trouble\u2014indeed, distress\u2014when trying to discard their possessions, even those that appear to have little value (sentimental or other - wise). As a result, things pile up, cluttering up living areas to render them unusable.

Though well educated (Columbia University) and a talented pianist, Langley Col- lyer probably never held gainful employment. He and his older brother, Homer, lived in the Harlem house left them by their parents, an obstetrician and his wife who were first cousins. Trained as a lawyer, Homer worked for a time, but his vision deteriorated and he suffered from arthritis. So, as they grew older, the brothers lived on their inherited money. They didn\u2019t require much: They had no gas, electricity, or telephone service. Even the water was eventually turned off. For decades, they essentially camped out indoors. Langley would walk miles to the store for supplies that he\u2019d bring home in a wagon, pulled along by a string. On these journeys, he also collected much of the debris that ultimately invaded their living space. Though he wore clothes long out of fashion, Lang- ley was not completely asocial. As reported from accounts of those who knew him, he was pleasant, at times grateful for company. He even admitted that he was too reclusive. In 1947, at age 61, Langley died, crushed",
    "their living space. Though he wore clothes long out of fashion, Lang- ley was not completely asocial. As reported from accounts of those who knew him, he was pleasant, at times grateful for company. He even admitted that he was too reclusive. In 1947, at age 61, Langley died, crushed under the weight of the booby trap he\u2019d designed and installed over a period of years to prevent criminals from stealing the brothers\u2019 possessions. Finding the doorways stuffed with 10-foot-high walls of bailed newspaper and other debris, police had to chop their way in. It took them over 2 weeks to find Langley\u2019s body, which lay just 10 feet from where Homer had subsequently also died\u2014of starvation. After the bodies had been removed, the house was cleared of its holdings. Workers found dressmaker\u2019s dummies, sheets of Braille, a doll carriage, bicycles, a photograph of Mickey Rooney, old advertisements, firearms and ammunition, parts for old radios, chunks of concrete, and shoelaces. The brothers had stored some of their body waste in jars. There was a two- headed baby preserved in formaldehyde (probably an artifact from their father\u2019s medical practice), a canoe, a dismantled Model T automobile, two pipe organs, thousands of empty tin cans, and 14 pianos. There were also tons of news- papers, saved so that Homer could catch up on the news, once he regained his sight. In all, the house eventually yielded 180 tons of junk, with everything covered in decades of dust. Evaluation of Langley Collyer The analysis of Langley\u2019s condition requires a little forgiveness. That\u2019s because, candidly, we must infer one criterion important for hoarding disorder: that no other medical dis- order could better explain the symptoms (criterion E). Langley and Homer famously refused to seek medical attention; hence Homer\u2019s crippling arthritis and, perhaps, his blindness. But Langley eschewed alcohol and drugs, and he appeared well enough for decades until the very end of his life\u2014when it all came, quite literally, crashing down. Hoarding can occur as a symptom of OCD , but as with most patients who hoard, Hoarding Disorder 209 we have no evidence of actual obsessions or (other) compulsions (F). Although there is no evidence for another mental disorder, neither have we positive evidence that Lang- ley did not suffer from, say, major depressive disorder (it and OCD are often comorbid with hoarding disorder).

    "of actual obsessions or (other) compulsions (F). Although there is no evidence for another mental disorder, neither have we positive evidence that Lang- ley did not suffer from, say, major depressive disorder (it and OCD are often comorbid with hoarding disorder). As for the other requirements of the syndrome, Langley was undeniably a collector whose accumulated tonnage didn\u2019t just impinge upon but engulfed the living space of the two hermit brothers (A, B, C). It imperiled their own health and that of any public service personnel who might be required to enter to give assistance; failing to maintain a safe environment satisfies the stress or impairment requirement (D). In the absence of direct testimony from Langley, we cannot know how deeply he understood his condition, so we must ignore the insight specifiers. However, we can probably agree that his collecting habits qualify for the specifier with excessive acquisi- tion\u2014as is the case in the vast majority of hoarders. Although we are no longer able to code something on the order of \u201cpersonality disorder, diagnosis deferred,\u201d if Langley were a living patient I\u2019d make some sort of note in my summary to that effect\u2014to alert me, or some other clinician down the road, that there was more diagnostic work to be done. I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 60. F42 [300.3] Hoarding disorder, with excessive acquisition F63.3 [312.39] Trichotillomania (Hair- Pulling Disorder) Trichotillomania comes from the Greek meaning \u201cpassion for pulling hair.\u201d As with pyromania and kleptomania, many such patients (but not all) feel a mounting tension until they succumb to the urge. Then, when they pull out the hair, they experience release. Usually beginning in childhood, hair- pullers repeatedly extract their own hair, beards, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Less often, they will pull hair from armpits, the pubic area, or other body locations. They usually don\u2019t report pain associated with the hair pulling, although they may note a tingling sensation. Some people put the hair into their mouths, and about 30% swallow it. If the hair is long, it can accumulate in the stomach or intestines as a bezoar (hairball) that may require surgical removal. Patients may be referred to mental health professionals by dermatologists, who note patchy hair loss. Onset of trichotillomania is usually in childhood or adolescence. (When it begins in an adult, it may be associated with psychosis.) The condition tends to wax and wane, but is",
    "that may require surgical removal. Patients may be referred to mental health professionals by dermatologists, who note patchy hair loss. Onset of trichotillomania is usually in childhood or adolescence. (When it begins in an adult, it may be associated with psychosis.) The condition tends to wax and wane, but is usually chronic. Trichotillomania is embarrassing to patients, who tend to be secretive, so it\u2019s unclear just how common it is. Some hair pulling can be found in up to 3% of the adult population, especially women, though far fewer (probably under 1%) meet full criteria for the disorder. It is far more common in females than in males, and it is especially common in people with intellectual disability. Hair pullers also tend to crack their knuckles, bite their nails, or excoriate themselves. The feeling of tension before hair pulling, and release or relief of stress afterwards, 210 OBSESSIVE\u2013COMPULSIVE AND rELATED DISO rDErS still characterizes many sufferers (though it is no longer a requirement for diagnosis). But patients who have the \u201ctension and release\u201d aspect of hair pulling may be in for a more severe course of the illness than those who don\u2019t report this feature. Essential Features of Trichotillomania Repeated pulling out of the patient\u2019s own hair results in bald patches and attempts to control the behavior.

She gazed at it a moment before dropping it onto the freshly vacuumed carpet. Rosalind had been pulling out her hair for nearly half her 30 years. She thought it had started during her sophomore or junior year in high school, when she was studying for final exams. Perhaps the tingling sensation on her scalp had helped her stay awake; she didn\u2019t know. \u201cNow it\u2019s a habit. I\u2019ve always only pulled the hairs from the very top of my head.\u201d",

I\u2019ve always only pulled the hairs from the very top of my head.\u201d The top of Rosalind\u2019s head bore a round, almost bald spot about the size of a sil - ver dollar. Only a few broken hairs and a sparse growth of new hair sprouted there. It looked like a tiny tonsure. \u201cIt used to make my mom really angry. She said I\u2019d end up looking like Dad.

Her physical health was good; she had no other compulsive behaviors or obsessive thinking. She denied using drugs or alcohol. Although she had no significant symptoms of depression, she admitted that her hair pulling was a serious problem for her. She could wear a hairpiece to hide her bald spot, but the knowledge that it was there had kept her from forming any close relationships with men. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough looking like a monk,\u201d Rosalind said. \u201cBut this thing has got me living like one, too.\u201d Trichotillomania (Hair- Pulling Disorder) 211 Evaluation of Rosalind Brewer Rosalind\u2019s symptoms of repeated hair pulling (criterion A) included the classic \u201ctension and release\u201d that used to be required for a diagnosis of trichotillomania, but now is only a frequent feature. She had no evidence of a dermatological disorder or other general medical condition (D) that might explain the condition (she was referred by a derma - tologist). The mental conditions that might be confused with trichotillomania would include OCD, in which compulsions are performed not as an end to themselves, but as a means of preventing anxiety. Hair pulling is sometimes found in body dysmorphic disorder, but all would agree that Rosalind had a cosmetic flaw.

With a GAF score of 70, her complete diagnosis would be straightforward: F63.3 [312.39] Trichotillomania L98.1 [698.4] Excoriation (Skin- Picking) Disorder Excoriation (skin- picking) disorder usually begins by adolescence, though sometimes later. These patients spend much time\u2014 perhaps hours each day\u2014 digging at their skin. Most will focus on head or face; fingernails tend to be the instruments of choice, though some people employ tweezers. Tension prior to the act, as with other disorders of impulse such as pyromania, is a frequent finding in these patients. Then the act of picking may yield gratification; subsequent embarrassment or shame can delay treat - ment. Infections are common, sometimes producing ulceration. Patients may use cos - metics to conceal the scarring and excoriations; some will avoid social events as a result. Other consequences can be dire. One patient picked so persistently at his neck and scalp that he picked right through his skull and developed an epidural abscess. The resultant quadriplegia resolved only partially; confined to a wheelchair, he ultimately resumed picking. Of course, this is the extreme; however, scarring and less harmful infections are common. Many patients will expend an hour or more each day engaged in picking behavior or its consequences. A third of patients with excoriation disorder currently have some other mental disorder, most notably trichotillomania, a mood disorder, or OCD; some bite their nails. Nearly half of patients with body dysmorphic disorder also pick at themselves. Excoria- tion is found in people with developmental disabilities, especially in those with Prader\u2013 Willi syndrome (see sidebar, p. 215). For a \u201cnew\u201d disorder (though it was described as early as 1889, its DSM-5 listing is its first appearance as an official mental disorder), excoriation disorder is surprisingly common; its prevalence is probably 2% or more. It tends to begin in adolescence and runs a chronic course. By a large majority, these patients tend to be female; many have relatives similarly afflicted. 212 OBSESSIVE\u2013COMPULSIVE AND rELATED DISO rDErS Essential Features of Excoriation (Skin- Picking)Disorder The patient frequently tries to stop the repeated digging, scratching, or picking at skin,",

A few of her lesions were still inflamed, and one on her forehead had scabbed over. She\u2019d cov - ered her fingernails with tape. When she was 11, Brittany had developed acne, which her mother would \u201crelieve\u201d by squeezing the pustules and blackheads. Brittany endured long minutes standing with her head wedged into a corner, her mother\u2019s muscular fingers digging away \u201cas if for gold,\u201d Brittany would recall years later. Released at last, she\u2019d run to the bathroom and dab cool water on her smarting, spotted face. She\u2019d hated her mother. Now in college, Brittany had taken over the squeezing and picking job, though she knew it only led to more damaged skin. Several times a week she\u2019d attack herself, usu- ally just a few minutes at a time, but longer if she was alone in the bathroom. She felt drawn to mirrors to inspect, to criticize her face; those inspections, inevitably, ushered in further bouts of destruction. Because she felt ashamed of the damage she\u2019d wreaked, she avoided dating. It had been 6 months since she\u2019d attended a play or a concert, even by herself. \u201cI hope you can help me,\u201d she said with a wry smile. \u201cMore than anything, I want to stop being my mother.\u201d Evaluation of Brittany Fitch Brittany\u2019s condition isn\u2019t hard to diagnose. The spots and scars (criterion A) and the taped fingernails (B) told much of the story, and her clinic visit testified to the distress her symptoms were causing (C). The most important question at this point would be this: Could another mental (or medical) disorder explain her symptoms? For that, her clinician would have to dig a little deeper, so to speak, into her history to make sure she didn\u2019t have OCD (E). Of course she didn\u2019t have body",

For that, her clinician would have to dig a little deeper, so to speak, into her history to make sure she didn\u2019t have OCD (E). Of course she didn\u2019t have body dysmorphic disorder : Her skin condition was perfectly evident to anyone who looked.

I would base her GAF score (60) on the degree of social disability she experienced. L98.1 [698.4] Excoriation disorder Substance/Medication- Induced Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive and Related Disorder Reports link obsessive\u2013 compulsive symptoms to use of codeine, cocaine, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. If these criteria look an awful lot like those for substance- induced anxiety disorders, it\u2019s because the two sections were one and the same in DSM-IV. That\u2019s one reason I\u2019ve elected not to include an additional vignette here. The other is that these conditions are probably vanishingly rare. A principal example is the foraging behavior noted in users of crack cocaine. For a few hours at most, heavy users will inspect the carpet or bare floor looking for bits of the drug they might have dropped. It always occurs as a withdrawal phenomenon, and though they realize it is in vain, they feel helpless to resist. Essential Features of Substance/Medication- Induced Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive and related Disorder The use of some substance appears to have caused obsessions, compulsions, hoard - ing, hair pulling, excoriation, or other recurring symptoms concerning the patient\u2019s own body.

Of course, association doesn\u2019t prove causation, but an etio- logical relationship has been claimed for Japanese B encephalitis and arachnoid cyst, among others. Obsessive\u2013 compulsive symptoms are also found with Sydenham\u2019s chorea, which results from streptococcus infection in children. Much has been written about the pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infec - tion (PANDAS), in which young children develop obsessions and compulsions as well as tics and other symptoms, but without the motor disorder of chorea. After years of study, a lot still isn\u2019t known\u2014 including whether PANDAS is an actual entity, and whether the alleged association is even genuine. (In 2013, a young man was arrested for planning to bomb his own high school near Portland, Oregon. In his defense, he cited OCD due to PANDAS.) Prader\u2013Willi syndrome is a rare (about 1 in 50,000) disorder associated with a portion of Dna mission from chromosome 15. The condition may be identified at birth with genetic testing of markedly hypotonic babies. Though some individuals with this syndrome have borderline normal intelligence, mild to moderate intellectual disability is common. Patients typically have short stature and hypogonadism; insatiable appetite often results in severe obesity. Some have mood symptoms and problems with impulse control. Patients with Prader\u2013Willi have also been reported to have hoarding behavior, foraging for food, skin picking, and obsessions with cleanliness\u2014almost a clean sweep of the disorders this chapter comprises. Essential Features of Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive and related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A physical condition appears to have caused a patient to have obsessions, compul - sions, hoarding, hair pulling, excoriation, or other recurrent symptoms concerning the patient\u2019s own body.

By now, you know the drill: The page number following each item indicates where a more detailed discussion begins. Primary Trauma- and Stressor- Related Disorders Reactive attachment disorder. There is evidence of pathogenic care in a child who habitually doesn\u2019t seek comfort from parents or surrogates (p. 231). Disinhibited social engagement disorder. There is evidence of pathogenic care in a child who fails to show normal reticence in the company of strangers (p. 231). Posttraumatic stress disorder. These adolescents or adults repeatedly relive a severely trau- matic event, such as combat or a natural disaster (p. 219). Posttraumatic stress disorder in preschool children.

Acute stress disorder. This condition is much like posttraumatic stress disorder, except that it begins during or immediately after the stressful event and lasts a month or less (p. 224). Adjustment disorder. Following a stressor, an individual develops symptoms that disappear once the cause of stress has subsided (p. 228). Other specified, or unspecified, trauma- and stressor- related disorder. Patients whose stress or trauma appears related to other presentations may be classified in one of these catego- ries (pp. 233, 234). Other Problems Related to Trauma or Stress Problems related to abuse or neglect. An astonishing number of Z-codes (V-codes in ICD-9) cover the categories of difficulties that arise from neglect or from physical or sexual abuse of children or adults (p. 594). Separation anxiety disorder. The patient becomes anxious when separated from parent, other attachment figure, or home (p. 188). Introduction Another new chapter for the DSMs incorporates certain diagnoses formerly listed as anxiety, developmental, or adjustment disorders. The unifying factor here is that some- thing traumatic or stressful in the patient\u2019s history appears to be at least partly respon- sible for the symptoms that develop. It is part of a trend toward grouping together patients of any age who have the right mix of symptoms, rather than separating patients by developmental stage. Many diagnoses include statements about what is not causative, but here is the only full DSM-5 section that presumes any etiology at all, let alone one rooted in the psychology of a pathological developmental process. In the instances of reactive attachment and disinhibited social engagement disor - ders, there must be evidence of pathogenic care; for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its cousins, a horrific event; for adjustment disorder a stressful\u2014well, stressor. The respective criteria sets permit us to check off the fulfilled criteria and go on our way, per - haps thinking that we\u2019ve solved the puzzle. While we rejoice that we\u2019ve successfully determined a cause\u2013effect relationship, nagging at the back of our minds must be a sense that there is more to the story. Other - wise, why do some people become symptomatic while others, exposed to the (as nearly as we can tell) exact same stimulus, go untrammeled on their way?

    "of our minds must be a sense that there is more to the story. Other - wise, why do some people become symptomatic while others, exposed to the (as nearly as we can tell) exact same stimulus, go untrammeled on their way? Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that, sooner or later, significant stressors will visit the majority of us. Shouldn\u2019t we conclude that the stimulus in question is necessary, but not sufficient, for the outcome observed? at least this DSM-5 chapter has herded most of these etiology- specific diagnoses into one corral, where we can keep a watchful eye on them. 218 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS F43.10 [309.81] Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Many people who survive severely traumatic events will develop PTSD. Survivors of combat are the most frequent victims, but it is also encountered in those who have experienced other disasters, both natural and contrived. These include rape, floods, abductions, and airplane crashes, as well as the threats that may be posed by a kidnap- ping or hostage situation. Children can have PTSD as a result of inappropriate sexual experience, whether or not actual injury has occurred. PTSD can be diagnosed even in those who have only learned about severe trauma (or its threat) suffered by someone to whom they are close\u2014 children, spouses, other close relatives. One or two in every 1,000 patients who have undergone general anesthesia have afterwards reported awareness of pain, anxiety, helplessness, and the fear of impending death during the procedure; up to half of them may subsequently develop PTSD symptoms. Implicitly excluded from the definition are stressful experiences of ordinary life, such as bereavement, divorce, and serious illness. Awakening from anesthesia while your surgery is still in progress, however, would qualify as a traumatic event, as would learning about a spouse\u2019s sudden, accidental death or a child\u2019s life- threatening illness. Watching TV images of a calamity would not be a sufficient stressor (except if the viewing was related to the person\u2019s job). After some delay (symptoms usually don\u2019t develop immediately after the trauma), the person in some way relives the traumatic event and tries to avoid thinking about it. There are also symptoms of physiological hyperarousal, such as an exaggerated startle response. Patients with PTSD also express negative feelings such as guilt or personal responsibility (\u201cI should have prevented it\u201d). Aside from the traumatic event itself, other factors may play a role in the devel",
    "avoid thinking about it. There are also symptoms of physiological hyperarousal, such as an exaggerated startle response. Patients with PTSD also express negative feelings such as guilt or personal responsibility (\u201cI should have prevented it\u201d). Aside from the traumatic event itself, other factors may play a role in the devel - opment of PTSD. Individual factors include the person\u2019s innate character structure and genetic inheritance. Relatively low intelligence and low educational attainment are positively associated with PTSD. Environmental influences include relatively low socioeconomic status and membership in a minority racial or ethnic group. In general, the more horrific or more enduring the trauma, the greater will be the likelihood of developing PTSD. The risk runs to one- quarter of the survivors of heavy combat and two- thirds of former prisoners of war. Those who have experienced natural disasters such as fires or floods are generally less likely to develop symptoms. (Overall lifetime prevalence of PTSD is estimated at about 9%, though European researchers usually report lower overall rates.) Older adults are less likely to develop symptoms than are younger ones, and women tend to have somewhat higher rates than do men. About half the patients recover within a few months; others can experience years of incapacity. In children, the general outline is pretty much the same as the five general points given in the list of typical symptoms, though the emphasis on symptom numbers dif - fers, as discussed below (p. 223). Mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders are frequently comorbid. A new speci- fier reflects findings that in perhaps 12\u201314% of patients, dissociation is important in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 219 Essential Features of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Something truly awful has happened. One patient has been gravely injured or per - haps sexually abused; another has been closely involved in the death or injury of someone else; a third has only learned that someone close experienced an accident or other violence, whereas emergency workers (police, firefighters) may be trauma- tized through repeated exposure. As a result, for many weeks or months these patients: \u2022\u2022 Repeatedly relive their event, perhaps in nightmares or upsetting dreams, perhaps in intrusive mental images or dissociative flashbacks. Some people respond to reminders of the event with physiological sensations (racing heart, shortness of breath) or emotional distress. \u2022\u2022 Take steps to avoid the horror: refusing to watch films or",

Some experience amnesia for aspects of the trauma; others become numb, feeling unable to love or experience joy. \u2022\u2022 Experience symptoms of hyperarousal: irritability, excessive vigilance, trouble concentrating, insomnia, or an intensified startle response. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (1+ months) \u2022 Distress or disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders [especially traumatic brain injury], mood and anxiety disorders, normal reactions to stressful events) Coding Notes Specify if: With delayed expression. Symptoms sufficient for diagnosis didn\u2019t accumulate until at least six months after the event. With dissociative symptoms: Depersonalization. This indicates feelings of detachment, as though dream- ing, from the patient\u2019s own mind or body. Derealization. To the patient, the surroundings seem distant, distorted, dreamlike, or unreal. 220 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS Barney Gorse \u201cThey\u2019re gooks! The place is staffed with gooks!\u201d Someone sitting behind Barney Gorse had dropped a book onto the tile floor, and that had set him off. Now he had backed into a corner in the waiting room of the mental health clinic. His pupils were widely dilated, and perspiration stood out on his fore - head. He was panting heavily. He pointed a shaky finger at the Asian student who stood petrified on the other side of the room. \u201cGet this goddamn gook out of here!\u201d He made a fist and lumbered off in the direction of the student. \u201cHang on, Barney. It\u2019s OK.\u201d Barney\u2019s new therapist took him firmly by the elbow and led him to a private office.

    "led him to a private office. They sat there in silence for a few minutes, while Barney\u2019s breathing gradually returned to normal and the clinician reviewed his chart. Barney Gorse was 39 now, but he had been barely 20 when his draft number came up and he joined the Ninth Infantry Division in Vietnam. At that time President Nixon was \u201cwinding down the war,\u201d which made it seem all the more painful when Barney\u2019s squad was hit by mortar fire from North Vietnamese regulars. He had never talked about it, even during \u201canger displacement\u201d group ther - apy with other veterans. Whenever he was asked to tell his story, he would fly into a rage. But something truly devastating must have happened to Barney that day. The reports mentioned a wound in the upper thigh; he had been the only member of his squad to survive the attack. He had been awarded a Purple Heart and a full pension. Barney hadn\u2019t been able to remember several hours of the attack at all. And he had always been careful to avoid films and television programs about war. He said he\u2019d had enough of it to last everybody\u2019s lifetime; in fact, he had gone to some lengths to avoid thinking about it. He celebrated his discharge from the Army by getting drunk, which was how he remained for 6 years. When he finally sobered up, he turned to drugs. Even they hadn\u2019t been enough to obliterate the nightmares that still haunted him; he awakened screaming several times a week. Sudden noises would startle him into a panic attack. Now, thanks to disulfiram and a chaplain in the county jail where he had been held as a persistent public nuisance, Barney had been clean and sober for 6 months. On the condition that he would seek treatment for his substance use, he had been released. The specialists in substance misuse treatment had quickly recognized that he had other problems, and that had led him here. Last week when they met, the therapist had reminded him again that he needed to dig into his feelings about the past. Barney had responded that he didn\u2019t have any feelings; they\u2019d dried up on him. For that matter, the future didn\u2019t look so good, either: \u201cGot no job, no wife, no kids.

I just can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 221 Evaluation of Barney Gorse Let\u2019s summarize and restate the criteria that must be fulfilled to diagnose PTSD. 1. There must be severe trauma (criterion A). Barney\u2019s occurred in the context of combat, but a variety of civilian stressors can also culminate in death, seri - ous injury, or sexual abuse. Two features must be present for the stressor to be considered sufficiently traumatic: (a) It must involve the fact or threat of death, severe wounds or injuries, or sexual violation; and (b) it must be person- ally experienced by the patient in some way\u2014 through direct observation (not viewed on TV), through personal involvement, or through information obtained after the fact that it involved a relative or close friend. A first responder (police officer, ambulance attendant) could also qualify through repeated exposure to consequences of the horrific event (think workers at Ground Zero shortly after 9/11). Divorce and death of a spouse from cancer, though undeniably stressful, are relatively commonplace and expected; they don\u2019t qualify. 2. Through some intrusive mechanism, the patient relives the stress . Barney had flashbacks (B3), during which he imagined himself actually back in Vietnam. He also experienced rather intense responses to an external cue (seeing a staff member who, to him, resembled a Viet Cong soldier). Less dramatic forms of recollection include recurrent ordinary memories, dreams, and any other reminder of the event that results in distress or physiological symptoms. 3. The patient attempts (wittingly or not) to achieve emotional distance from the stressful event by avoiding reminders of the trauma. The reminders can be either internal (feelings, thoughts) or external (people, places, activities). Bar - ney refused to watch movies and TV programs or to talk about Vietnam (C). 4. The patient experiences expressions (two or more) of negative mood and thoughts related to the trauma. Barney\u2019s included amnesia for much of his time in combat (D1), a persistently negative frame of mind (\u201cI wasn\u2019t meant to have a life\u201d\u2014D4), and the lack of positive mood",
    "about Vietnam (C). 4. The patient experiences expressions (two or more) of negative mood and thoughts related to the trauma. Barney\u2019s included amnesia for much of his time in combat (D1), a persistently negative frame of mind (\u201cI wasn\u2019t meant to have a life\u201d\u2014D4), and the lack of positive mood states (his feelings had \u201cdried up\u201d on him, D7). 5. Finally, for PTSD, patients must have at least two symptoms of heightened arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event. Barney suffered from insomnia (E6) and a severe startle response (E4); others may experience general irritability, poor concentration, or excessive vigilance. As with all symp- toms, the clinician would have to determine that these symptoms of arousal had not been apparent before Barney\u2019s Vietnam trauma. Barney\u2019s symptoms had persisted far longer than the required minimum of 1 month (F); were obviously stressful and impaired his functioning in a number of areas (G); and could not be attributed to the direct effects of substance use\u2014now that he\u2019d been clean and sober for half a year (H). 222 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS The experience of severe trauma in combat and the typical symptoms would ren - der any other explanation for Barney\u2019s symptoms unlikely. A patient with intermittent explosive disorder might become aggressive and lose control, but wouldn\u2019t have the history of trauma. Still, clinicians must always be alert to the possibility of another medical condition (H) that might produce anxiety symptoms and could be diagnosed instead of or in addition to PTSD. For example, head injuries would be relatively com- mon among veterans of combat or other violent trauma; we\u2019d have to mention and code any accompanying brain injury. Situational adjustment disorder shouldn\u2019t be confused with PTSD: The severity of the trauma would be far less, and the effects would be transient and less dramatic. In PTSD, comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception. Barney had used drugs and alcohol; his clinician would have gathered additional information about use of other substances and mentioned them in his diagnostic summary. Of combat veterans who have PTSD, half or more also have a problem with a substance use disorder , and use of multiple substances is common. Anxiety disorders ( phobic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder) and mood disorders (major depressive disorder and dysthymia) are likewise common in this population. Dissociative amnesia may also occur. Any coexist- ing personality disorder would be explored,",
    "a problem with a substance use disorder , and use of multiple substances is common. Anxiety disorders ( phobic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder) and mood disorders (major depressive disorder and dysthymia) are likewise common in this population. Dissociative amnesia may also occur. Any coexist- ing personality disorder would be explored, but it is hard to make a definitive diagnosis when a patient is acutely ill from PTSD. Malingering is also a diagnosis to consider whenever there appears to be a possibility of material gain (insurance, disability, legal problems) resulting from an accident or physical attack. Although the vignette is imprecise on this point, Barney\u2019s symptoms probably began by the time he was discharged from the military, so he would not rate the speci- fier with delayed onset. The vignette doesn\u2019t provide encouragement to add with promi- nent dissociation . I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 35. Pending further information on substance use, Barney\u2019s diagnosis would read as follows: F43.10 [309.81] Posttraumatic stress disorder F10.20 [303.90] Alcohol use disorder, moderate, in early remission Z60.2 [V60.3] Lives alone Z56.9 [V62.29] Unemployed There is still considerable controversy over the specifier with delayed expression . Many experts deny that symptoms of PTSD can begin many months or years after the trauma. nonetheless, it is there to use, should you ever find it appropriate. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Preschool Children There can be no doubt that preschool children are sometimes exposed to traumatic events. Mostly, these are car accidents, natural disasters, and war\u2014in short, all the benefits contemporary life has to offer. The question is, do very young children respond Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 223 with typical PTSD symptoms? The best evidence would seem to indicate that they do, but with a likelihood much lower (0\u201312%) than for older children. Table 6.1 compares the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD in young children, PTSD in adults, and acute stress disorder (to be discussed next). The revamped criteria for PTSD in young children are, as we would hope, more sensitive to symptoms in this age group. Based on interviews with parents, they yield rates in children who have survived severe burns of 25% and 10% at 1 month and 6 months, respectively. F43 [308.3] Acute Stress Disorder Based on the observation that some people develop symptoms immediately after a traumatic stress, acute stress disorder (ASD) was devised several decades ago.

F43 [308.3] Acute Stress Disorder Based on the observation that some people develop symptoms immediately after a traumatic stress, acute stress disorder (ASD) was devised several decades ago. Even then, this wasn\u2019t exactly new information; something similar was noted as far back as 1865, just after the U.S. Civil War. For many years it was termed \u201cshell shock.\u201d Like PTSD, ASD can also be found among civilians. Overall rates of ASD, depending on the nature of the trauma and personal characteristics of the individual, center on 20%. Though the number and distribution of symptoms is different, the criteria embody the same elements required for PTSD: \u2022\u2022 Exposure to an event that threatens body integrity \u2022\u2022 Reexperiencing the event \u2022\u2022 Avoidance of stimuli associated with the event \u2022\u2022 Negative changes in mood and thought \u2022\u2022 Increased arousal and reactivity \u2022\u2022 Distress or impairment The symptoms usually begin as soon as the patient is exposed to the event (or learns about it), but they must be experienced farther out than 3 days after the stressful event to fulfill the criterion for duration. This gets us to a period of time beyond the stressful event itself and its immediate aftermath. Should symptoms last longer than 1 month, they are no longer acute and no longer constitute ASD. Then many patients will be rolled over into a diagnosis of PTSD. This is the fate of as many as 80% of patients with ASD. However, patients with PTSD don\u2019t usually enter through the ASD door - way; most are identified farther along the road than one month. 224 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS TABLE 6.1.

As a result, for up to a month the patient experiences many symptoms such as intrusive memories or bad dreams; dissociative experiences such as flashbacks or feeling unreal; the inability to experience joy or other love; amnesia for parts of the event; attempts to avoid reminders of the event (refusing to watch films or television or to read accounts of the event); pushing thoughts or memories out of consciousness. The patient may also experience symptoms of hyperarousal: irritability, hypervigilance, trouble concentrating, insomnia, or an intense startle response.

    "disorders (especially traumatic brain injury), panic disorder, mood disorders, dissocia- tive disorders, PTSD) Marie Trudeau Marie Trudeau and her husband, Andr\u00e9, sat in the intake interviewer\u2019s office. Marie was the patient, but she spent most of the time rubbing the knuckles of one hand and gazing vacantly into the room. Andr\u00e9 did most of the talking. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe the change in her,\u201d he said. \u201cA week ago, she was completely normal. Never had anything like this in her life. Heck, she\u2019s never had anything wrong with her. Then, all of a sudden, boom! She\u2019s a mess.\u201d At Andr\u00e9\u2019s exclamation, Marie jerked around to face him and rose half out of her chair. For a few seconds she stood there, frozen except for her gaze, which darted from one side of the room to the other. \u201cAw, geez, I\u2019m sorry, honey. I forgot.\u201d He put his arm around her. Grasping her shoulders firmly but gently, he eased her back into the chair. He held her there until she began to relax her grip on his arm. A week earlier, Marie had just finished her gardening and was sitting in the back yard with a lemonade, reading a book. When she heard airplane engines, she looked up and saw two small planes flying high overhead, directly above her. \u201cMy God,\u201d she thought, \u201cthey\u2019re going to collide!\u201d As she watched in horror, they did collide. She could see perfectly. The sun was low, highlighting the two planes brilliantly against the deep blue of the late afternoon sky. Something seemed to have been torn off one of them\u2014the news media later reported that the right wing of one plane had ripped right through the cockpit of the other. Thinking to call 911, Marie picked up her 226 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS portable phone, but she didn\u2019t dial. She could only watch as two tiny objects suddenly appeared beside the stricken airplanes and tumbled toward her in a leisurely arc. \u201cThey weren\u2019t objects, they were people.\u201d It was the first time she had spoken during the interview. Marie\u2019s chin trembled, and a lock of hair fell across her eye. She didn\u2019t try to brush it back. As she continued to watch, one of the bodies hurtled into her yard 15 feet from where she was sitting. It buried itself 6 inches deep in the soft earth behind her rose bushes. What happened next,",

It buried itself 6 inches deep in the soft earth behind her rose bushes. What happened next, Marie seemed to have blanked out completely. The other body landed in the street a block away. Half an hour later, when the police knocked on her door, they found her in the kitchen peeling carrots for supper and crying into the sink. When Andr\u00e9 arrived home an hour after that, she seemed dazed. All she would say was \u201cI\u2019m not here.\u201d In the 6 days since, Marie hadn\u2019t improved much. Although she might start a con- versation, something would appear to distract her, and she would usually trail off in midsentence. She couldn\u2019t focus much better on her work at home. Amy, their 9-year- old daughter, seemed to be taking care of her. Sleep had slipped to a restless struggle, and three nights running Marie had awakened from a dream, trying to cry out but man- aging only a terrified squeak. She kept the blinds in the kitchen closed, so she wouldn\u2019t even have to look into the back yard. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone I saw in a World War II movie,\u201d Andr\u00e9 concluded. \u201cYou\u2019d think she\u2019d been shell- shocked.\u201d Evaluation of Marie Trudeau Anxiety and depressive symptoms are nearly universal following a severe stress. Usu - ally these are relatively short-lived, however, and do not include the full spectrum of symptoms required for ASD. This diagnosis should only be considered when major symptoms last 3 days or more after personal exposure to a horrific event. Such an event was the plane crash Marie witnessed (criterion A2). She was dazed (B6) and emotion - ally unresponsive (B5), and could not recall what had happened during part of the acci- dent (B7). When she could sleep at all (B10), she had nightmares (B2); she also avoided looking into the back yard (B9), startled easily (B14), and even in the interviewer\u2019s office appeared hypervigilant (B12). From her inability to finish conversations, we infer poor concentration (B13), as she was distracted by intrusive recollections of the event (B1). As far as we are aware, she had had none of these symptoms (DSM-5 requires 9 of the 14 symptoms listed in criterion B) prior",
    "appeared hypervigilant (B12). From her inability to finish conversations, we infer poor concentration (B13), as she was distracted by intrusive recollections of the event (B1). As far as we are aware, she had had none of these symptoms (DSM-5 requires 9 of the 14 symptoms listed in criterion B) prior to witnessing the accident. Since then, just a week earlier (C), she had been unable to carry on with her work at home (D). Would any other diagnosis be possible? According to Andr\u00e9, Marie\u2019s previous health had been good, reducing the likelihood of another medical condition (E). We aren\u2019t told whether she used alcohol or drugs, though the fact that she was drinking lemonade at the time of the crash could suggest that she did not. (OK, I\u2019m definitely out on a limb here; her clinician needs to rule out a substance use disorder. ) Brief Acute Stress Disorder 227 psychotic disorder would be ruled out by the lack of delusions, hallucinations, or dis - organized behavior or speech. Patients with ASD are likely to have severe depressive symptoms (\u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d), to the point that a concomitant diagnosis of major depressive disorder may sometimes be justified; Marie deserves further investigation along those lines. Until then, with a GAF score of 61, her diagnosis would be straightforward: F43.0 [308.3] Acute stress disorder Adjustment Disorder Patients with adjustment disorder (AD) may be responding to one stress or to many; the stressor may happen once or repeatedly. If the stressor goes on and on, it can even become chronic, as when a child lives with parents who fight continually. In clinical sit- uations, the stressor has usually affected only one person, but it can affect many (think flood, fire, and famine). However, almost any relatively commonplace event could be a stressor for someone. Those most often cited for adults are getting married or divorced, moving, and financial problems; for adolescents, they are problems at school. Whatever the nature of the stressor, patients feels overwhelmed by the demands of something in the environment. As a result, they develop emotional symptoms such as low mood, crying spells, complaints of feeling nervous or panicky, and other depressive or anxiety symptoms\u2014 which must not, however, meet criteria for any defined mood or anxiety disorder. Some patients have mainly behavioral symptoms\u2014 especially ones we might think of as conduct symptoms, such as driving dangerously, fighting, or defaulting on",
    "crying spells, complaints of feeling nervous or panicky, and other depressive or anxiety symptoms\u2014 which must not, however, meet criteria for any defined mood or anxiety disorder. Some patients have mainly behavioral symptoms\u2014 especially ones we might think of as conduct symptoms, such as driving dangerously, fighting, or defaulting on responsibili- ties. The course is usually relatively brief; DSM-5 criteria specify that the symptoms must not persist longer than 6 months after the end of the stressor or its consequences. (Some studies report that a large minority of patients continue to have symptoms longer than the 6-month limit.) Of course, if the stressor is one that will be ongoing, such as a chronic illness, it may take a very long time for the patient to adjust. Although AD has been reported in 10% or more of adult primary care patients, and in huge percentages of mental health patients, one recent study found a prevalence of only 3%; many of these patients were being inappropriately treated with psychotropic medications, and in only two cases had the AD diagnosis been made. The discrepancies probably rest on the rather poorly developed criteria and on the (mistaken) view of AD as a residual diagnosis. AD is found in all cultures and age groups, including children. It may be more firmly anchored in adults than in adolescents, whose early symptoms often evolve into other, more definitive mental disorders. The reliability and validity of AD tend to be quite low. In a recent study, in under two- thirds of patients receiving the clinical diag- nosis of AD could it be subsequently confirmed with ICD-10 criteria. 228 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS Personality disorders or cognitive disorders may make a person more vulnerable to stress, and hence to AD. Patients in whom AD is diagnosed often misuse substances as well. Essential Features of Adjustment Disorder A stressor causes someone to develop depression, anxiety, or behavioral symptoms\u2014 but the response exceeds what you\u2019d expect for most people in similar circumstances. After the stressor has ended, the symptoms might drag on, but not longer than 6 more months.

Adjustment Disorder 229 Clarissa Wetherby \u201cI know it\u2019s temporary, and I know I\u2019m overreacting. I sure don\u2019t want to, but I just feel upset!\u201d Clarissa Wetherby was speaking of her husband\u2019s new work schedule. Arthur Wetherby was foreman on a road- paving crew whose current job was to widen and resurface a portion of the interstate highway just a few miles from the couple\u2019s house. Because the section the crew was working on involved an interchange with another major highway, the work had to be done at night. For the past 2 months, Arthur had slept days and gone to work at 8:00 p.m. Clarissa worked the day shift as cashier in a restaurant. Except on weekends, when he tried to revert to a normal sleep schedule so he could be with her, they hardly ever saw one another. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been abandoned,\u201d she said. The Wetherbys had been married only 3 years, and they had no children. Each partner had been married once before; each was 35. Neither drank or used drugs. Clarissa\u2019s only previous encounter with the mental health system had occurred 7 years earlier, when her first husband had left her for another",
    "Wetherbys had been married only 3 years, and they had no children. Each partner had been married once before; each was 35. Neither drank or used drugs. Clarissa\u2019s only previous encounter with the mental health system had occurred 7 years earlier, when her first husband had left her for another man. \u201cI respected his right not to continue living a lie,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I felt terribly alone and humiliated.\u201d Clarissa\u2019s symptoms now were much as they had been then. Most of the time when she was at work, she felt \u201cabout normal\u201d and maintained good interest in what she was doing. But when alone at home in the evenings, she would be overwhelmed by waves of sadness. These left her virtually immobilized, unable even to turn on the television for company. She often cried to herself and felt guilty for giving in to her emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if someone had died, after all.\u201d Although she had some difficulty getting to sleep at night, she slept soundly in the morning. Her weight was constant, her appetite was good, and she had no suicidal ideas or death wishes. She did not report any problems with her concentration. She denied ever having mania symptoms. The previous time she\u2019d sought help, she had remained depressed and upset until a few weeks after the divorce was final. Then she seemed suddenly able to put it behind her and begin dating once again. \u201cI know I\u2019ll feel better, once Arthur gets off that schedule,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess it just makes me feel worthless, playing second fiddle to an overpass.\u201d Evaluation of Clarissa Wetherby As she herself recognized, Clarissa\u2019s reaction to the stress of her husband\u2019s work sched- ule might be considered extreme by some observers. That is one of the important points of this diagnosis: The patient\u2019s misery seems disproportionate to the apparent degree of the stress that has caused it (criterion B1). Her history provides a clue as to the source of her reaction: She was reminded of that awful time when her previous husband aban- doned her\u2014for good, and under circumstances that she considered humiliating. It is important, however, always to consider carefully whether a patient\u2019s reaction occurs as a nonpathological response to a genuine danger, which was not the case with Clarissa. 230 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS The time course of Clarissa\u2019s symptoms was right for AD: They developed shortly",

It is important, however, always to consider carefully whether a patient\u2019s reaction occurs as a nonpathological response to a genuine danger, which was not the case with Clarissa. 230 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS The time course of Clarissa\u2019s symptoms was right for AD: They developed shortly after she learned about Arthur\u2019s new work schedule (A). Although we have no way of knowing how long this episode might last, her previous episode ended after a few months, when the aftermath of her divorce had subsided (E). Of course, bereavement didn\u2019t enter into her differential diagnosis (D). Note that AD is not intended as a residual diagnosis, though it is often used that way. Nonetheless, it does come at the end of a long differential diagnosis that com - prises every other condition listed in DSM-5 (C). For Clarissa, the symptoms of mood disorder were the most prominent. She had never been manic, so could not qualify for a bipolar disorder. She had low mood, but only when alone in the evenings (not most of the day). She maintained interest in her work (rather than experiencing loss of inter- est in nearly all activities). Without at least one of these symptoms, there could not be a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, regardless of her guilt feelings, low energy, and trouble getting to sleep at night. Of course, her symptoms had lasted far less than 2 years, ruling out dysthymia. Although she remained fully functional at work, she was seriously distressed, fulfilling the severity requirement. The question of PTSD (and acute stress disorder) often arises in the differential diagnosis of AD. Each of those diagnoses requires that the stressor threaten serious harm and that the patient react with a variety of responses; Clarissa did not fulfill these conditions. She similarly did not have symptoms that would suggest generalized anxiety disorder, another diagnosis prominent in the differential for AD. A personality disorder may worsen (and hence become more apparent) with stress, but there is no hint that Clarissa had any lifelong character pathology. I\u2019d assign her a GAF score of 61. F43.21 [309.0] Adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, acute although some data support the utility of a D, which has been used clinically for decades, I recommend reserving it as a diagnosis of \u201calmost last resort.\u201d There are several reasons for this warning.

    "61. F43.21 [309.0] Adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, acute although some data support the utility of a D, which has been used clinically for decades, I recommend reserving it as a diagnosis of \u201calmost last resort.\u201d There are several reasons for this warning. For one thing, we probably too often use it when we simply have no better idea of what is going on. For another, the DSM-5 criteria do not tell us how we are to differentiate ordinary events from those that are stressful enough to cause depression, anxiety, or aber- rant behavior. I suspect that an event is singled out solely on the basis that it causes and emotional or behavioral problem, and that seems to me a tad circular. F94.1 [313.89] Reactive Attachment Disorder F94.2 [313.89] Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder In two apparently rare but extremely serious disorders, children who have been mis - treated (by accident or design) respond by becoming either extremely withdrawn or Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder 231 pathologically outgoing. For neither disorder do we have a lot of information, placing these two among the least well understood of mental disorders that affect children (or adults, for that matter). Each disorder is conceived as a reaction to an environment in which the child experiences caregiving that is inconstant (frequent change of parent or surrogate) or pathological (abuse, neglect). One of two patterns then develops. In reactive attachment disorder (RAD), even young infants withdraw from social contacts, appearing shy or distant. Inhibited children will resist separation by tantrums or desperate clinging. In severe cases, infants may exhibit failure-to- thrive syndrome, with head circumference, length, and weight hovering around the 3rd percentile on standard growth charts. By contrast, a child\u2019s response in disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED) borders on the promiscuous. Small children eschew normal wariness and boldly approach strangers; instead of clinging, they may instead appear indifferent to the departure of a parent. In both subtypes, the abnormal responses are more obvious when the main caregiver is absent. Factors that indicate increased risk for either RAD or DSED include being reared in an orphanage or other institution; protracted hospitalizations; multiple and frequent changes in caregivers; severe poverty; abuse (the gamut of physical, emotional, and sexual); and a family riven by death, divorce, or discord. Complications associated with these disorders include stunted physical growth, low self- esteem, delinquency, anger management issues, eating disorders, malnutrition, depression or",
    "other institution; protracted hospitalizations; multiple and frequent changes in caregivers; severe poverty; abuse (the gamut of physical, emotional, and sexual); and a family riven by death, divorce, or discord. Complications associated with these disorders include stunted physical growth, low self- esteem, delinquency, anger management issues, eating disorders, malnutrition, depression or anxiety, and later sub- stance misuse. In either disorder, a constant, nourishing relationship with a sensitive caregiver is required to reestablish adequate physical and emotional growth. Without such a rem - edy, the conditions tend to persist into adolescence. There has been almost no follow-up into adult life; despite a dearth of reliable information, you will (of course) find websites. DSM-IV listed these two conditions as subcategories of one disorder. Because of differences in symptoms, course, treatment response, and other correlates, DSM-5 now treats them as separate diagnoses\u2014 despite their supposed common etiology. However, some children will appear withdrawn when very young, then become disinhibited later, whereas others have symptoms of both conditions simultaneously. The upshot is that some observers find the dichotomy a bit forced. Essential Features of reactive Attachment Disorder Adverse child care (abuse, neglect, caregiving insufficient or changed too frequently) has apparently caused a child to withdraw emotionally; the child neither seeks nor responds to soothing from an adult. Such children will habitually show little emo - tional or social response; far from having positive affect, they may experience peri - ods of unprovoked irritability or sadness. 232 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS The Fine Print The presumption of causality stems from the temporal relationship of the traumatic child care to the disturbed behavior.

Such children, rather than showing typical first- acquaintance shyness, will little hesitate to leave with a strange adult; they don\u2019t \u201ccheck in\u201d with familiar care- givers, and readily become excessively familiar.

F43.8 [309.89] Other Specified Trauma- or Stressor- Related Disorder This diagnosis will serve to categorize those patients for whom there is an evident stressor or trauma, but who for a specific, stated reason don\u2019t fulfill criteria for any of the Other Specified Trauma- or Stressor- related Disorder 233 standard diagnoses already mentioned above. DSM-5 gives several examples, including two forms of adjustment-like disorders (one form with delayed onset and another with prolonged duration relative to adjustment disorder). Others are as follows: Persistent complex bereavement disorder. For at least a year, a patient experi - ences intense grief for someone close who has died. There may be yearning and preoccupation of thoughts for the person, or continuing ruminations over the cir - cumstance of death. A number of other symptoms express the patient\u2019s loss of iden- tity and reactive distress. Proposed criteria and discussion are given in Section III of DSM-5 on page 789. Various cultural syndromes. You\u2019ll find a number of these in an appendix in DSM- 5, page 833. F43.9 [309.9] Unspecified Trauma- or Stressor- Related Disorder This diagnosis will serve to categorize those patients for whom there is an evident stressor or trauma, but who don\u2019t fulfill criteria for any of the standard diagnoses already mentioned above, and for whom you do not care to specify the reasons why the criteria are not fulfilled. 234 TrAUMA- AND STrESSOr-rELATED DISOrDErS 235 CHAPTEr 7 Dissociative Disorders Quick Guide to the Dissociative Disorders Dissociative symptoms are principally covered in this chapter, but there are some conditions (especially involving loss or lapse of memory) that are classified elsewhere.

    "Dissociative symptoms are principally covered in this chapter, but there are some conditions (especially involving loss or lapse of memory) that are classified elsewhere. Yep, the page number following each item indicates where a more detailed discussion begins. Primary Dissociative Disorders Dissociative amnesia. The patient cannot remember important information that is usually of a personal nature. This amnesia is usually stress- related (p. 239). Dissociative identity disorder. One or more additional identities intermittently seize control of the patient\u2019s behavior (p. 245). Depersonalization/derealization disorder. There are episodes of detachment, as if the patient is observing the patient\u2019s own behavior from outside. In this condition, there is no actual memory loss (p. 237). Other specified, or unspecified, dissociative disorder. Patients who have symptoms sugges- tive of any of the disorders above, but who do not meet criteria for any one of them, may be placed in one of these two categories (p. 248). Other Causes of Marked Memory Loss When dissociative symptoms are encountered in the course of other mental diagnoses, a separate diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is not ordinarily given. Panic attack. Some patients panic may experience depersonalization or derealization as part of an acute panic attack (p. 173). Posttraumatic stress disorder. A month or more following a severe trauma, the patient may not remember important aspects of personal history (p. 219). Acute stress disorder. Immediately following a severe trauma, patients may not remember important aspects of personal history (p. 224). Somatic symptom disorder. Patients who have a history of somatic symptoms that cannot be explained on the basis of known disease mechanisms can also forget important aspects of personal history (p. 251). Non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder, sleepwalking type. Sleepwalking resem - bles the dissociative disorders, in that there is amnesia for purposeful behavior. But it is clas- sified elsewhere in order to keep all the sleep disorders together (p. 331). Borderline personality disorder. When severely stressed, these people will sometimes expe- rience episodes of dissociation, such as depersonalization (p. 545). Malingering. Some patients consciously feign symptoms of memory loss. Their object is material gain, such as avoiding punishment or obtaining money or drugs (p. 599). Introduction Dissociation occurs when one group of normal mental processes becomes separated from the rest. In essence, some of an individual\u2019s thoughts, feelings, or behaviors are removed from conscious awareness and control. For example, an otherwise healthy col- lege student cannot recall",
    "punishment or obtaining money or drugs (p. 599). Introduction Dissociation occurs when one group of normal mental processes becomes separated from the rest. In essence, some of an individual\u2019s thoughts, feelings, or behaviors are removed from conscious awareness and control. For example, an otherwise healthy col- lege student cannot recall any of the events of the previous 2 weeks. As with so many other mental symptoms, you can have dissociation without dis - order; if it\u2019s mild, it can be entirely normal. (Perhaps, for example, while enduring a boring lecture, you once daydreamed about your weekend plans, unaware that you\u2019ve been called on for a response?) There\u2019s also a close connection between the phenomena of dissociation and hypnosis. Indeed, over half the people interviewed in some surveys have had some experience of a dissociative nature. Episodes of dissociation severe enough to constitute a disorder have several fea - tures in common: \u2022\u2022 They usually begin and end suddenly. \u2022\u2022 They are perceived as a disruption of information that is needed by the indi - vidual. They can be positive, in the sense of something added (for example, flash- backs) or negative (a period of time for which the person has no memory). 236 DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS \u2022\u2022 Although clinicians often disagree as to their etiology, many episodes are appar- ently precipitated by psychological conflict. \u2022\u2022 Although they are generally regarded as rare, their numbers may be increasing. \u2022\u2022 In most (except depersonalization/derealization disorder), there is a profound disturbance of memory. \u2022\u2022 Impaired functioning or a subjective feeling of distress is required only for dis - sociative amnesia and depersonalization/derealization disorder. conversion symptoms (typical of the somatic symptom disorders) and dissociation tend to involve the same psychic mechanisms. Whenever you encounter a patient who dissociates, consider whether such a diagnosis is also warranted. F48.1 [300.6] Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder Depersonalization can be defined as a sense of being cut off or detached from oneself. This feeling may be experienced as viewing one\u2019s own mental processes or behavior; some patients feel as though they are in a dream. When a patient is repeatedly dis - tressed by episodes of depersonalization, and there is no other disorder that better accounts for the symptoms, you can diagnose depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD). DSM-5 offers another route to that diagnosis: through the experience of dereal - ization, a feeling that the exterior world is unreal or odd. Patients may",
    "- tressed by episodes of depersonalization, and there is no other disorder that better accounts for the symptoms, you can diagnose depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD). DSM-5 offers another route to that diagnosis: through the experience of dereal - ization, a feeling that the exterior world is unreal or odd. Patients may notice that the size or shape of objects has changed, or that other people seem robotic or even dead. Always, however, the person retains insight that it is only a change in perception\u2014that the world itself has remained the same. Because about half of all adults have had at least one such episode, we need to place some limits on who receives this diagnosis. It should not be made unless the symptoms are persistent or recurrent, and unless they impair functioning or cause pretty significant distress (this means something well beyond the bemused reflection, \u201cWell, that was weird!\u201d). In fact, depersonalization and derealization are much more commonly encountered as symptoms than as a diagnosis. For example, derealization or depersonalization is one of the qualifying symptoms for panic attack (p. 173). Episodes of DDD are often precipitated by stress; they may begin and end sud - denly. The disorder usually has its onset in the teens or early 20s; usually it is chronic. Although still not well studied, prevalence rates in the general population appear to be around 1\u20132%, with males and females nearly equal. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder 237 Essential Features of Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder A patient experiences depersonalization or derealization, but reality testing remains intact throughout.

Stuff like \u2018Now she\u2019ll have to call the assistant manager to get approval for this transfer of funds.\u2019 I came to the clinic because I saw something like this on television a few nights ago, and the person got shock treatments. That\u2019s when I began to worry something really awful was wrong.\u201d Francine denied that she had ever had blackout spells, convulsions, blows to the head, severe headaches, or dizziness. She had smoked pot a time or two in high school, but otherwise she was drug- and alcohol-free. Her physical health had been excellent; her only visits to physicians had been for immunizations, Pap smears, and a preemploy- ment physical exam 2 years ago. Each episode began suddenly, without warning. First Francine would feel quite anxious; then she\u2019d notice that her head seemed to bob up and down slightly, out of her control. Occasionally she felt a warm sensation on the top of her head, as if some - one had cracked a half- cooked egg that was dribbling yolk down through her hairline. The episodes seldom lasted longer than a few minutes, but they were becoming more frequent\u2014 several times a week now. If they occurred while she was at work, she could often take a break until they passed. But several times it had happened when she was driving. She worried that she might lose control of her car. Francine had never heard voices or had hallucinations of other senses; she denied ever feeling talked about or plotted against in any way. She had never had suicidal ideas and didn\u2019t really feel depressed. \u201cJust scared,\u201d she concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s so spooky to feel that you\u2019ve sort of died.\u201d 238 DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS Evaluation of Francine Parfit The sensation of being an outside observer of yourself can be quite unsettling; it is one that many people who are not patients have had a time or two.

    "DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS Evaluation of Francine Parfit The sensation of being an outside observer of yourself can be quite unsettling; it is one that many people who are not patients have had a time or two. What makes Francine\u2019s experience stand out is the fact that it returned often enough (criterion A1) and forc - ibly enough to cause her considerable distress\u2014enough to seek an evaluation, at any rate (C). (She was a little unusual in that her episodes didn\u2019t seem to be precipitated by stress; in many people, they are.) Notice that she described her experience \u201cas if I were a different person,\u201d not \u201cI am a different person.\u201d This tells us that she retained contact with reality (B). Francine\u2019s experiences and feelings were much like those of Shorty Rheinbold (p. 174), except that his occurred as symptoms of panic disorder. A variety of other conditions include depersonalization as a symptom: posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, cognitive, mood, personality, and substance- related disorders; schizophre- nia; and epilepsy (D, E). However, Francine did not complain of panic attacks or have symptoms of other disorders that could account for the symptoms. Note a new feature in DSM-5: Francine could also have received this diagnosis if she had experienced only symptoms of derealization. With a GAF score of 70, her diagnosis would be: F48.1 [300.6] Depersonalization/derealization disorder Though it goes unmentioned in DSM-5, a collection of symptoms called the phobic anxiety depersonalization syndrome sometimes occurs, especially in young women. In addition to depression, such patients, not surprisingly, have phobias, anxiety, and depersonalization. This condition may be a variant of major depressive disorder, with atypical features. F44.0 [300.12] Dissociative Amnesia There are two main requirements for dissociative amnesia (DA): (1) The patient has for- gotten something important, and (2) other disorders have been ruled out. Of course, the central feature is the inability to remember significant events. Over 100 years ago, clini- cians like Pierre Janet recognized several patterns in which this forgetting can occur: Localized (or circumscribed). The patient has recall for none of the events that occurred within a particular time frame, often during a calamity such as a wartime battle or a natural disaster. Selective. Certain portions of a time period, such as the birth of a child, have been forgotten. This type is less common.

    "often during a calamity such as a wartime battle or a natural disaster. Selective. Certain portions of a time period, such as the birth of a child, have been forgotten. This type is less common. Dissociative Amnesia 239 The next three types are much less common, and may eventually lead to a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder (see below): Generalized. All of the experiences during the patient\u2019s entire lifetime have been forgotten. Continuous. The patient forgets all events from a given time forward to the pres - ent. This is now extremely rare. Systematized. The patient has forgotten certain classes of information, such as that relating to family or to work. DA begins suddenly, usually following severe stress such as physical injury, guilt about an extramarital affair, abandonment by a spouse, or internal conflict over sexual issues. Sometimes the patient wanders aimlessly near home. Duration ranges widely, from minutes to perhaps years, after which the amnesia usually ends abruptly with complete recovery of memory. In some individuals, it may occur again, perhaps more than once. DA has still received insufficient study, so too little is known about demographic patterns, family occurrence, and the like. Beginning during early adulthood, it is most commonly reported in young women; it may occur in 1% or less of the general popula- tion, though recent surveys have pegged it somewhat higher. Many patients with DA have reported childhood sexual trauma, with a high percentage who cannot remember the actual abuse. Dissociative Fugue In the subtype of DA known as dissociative fugue, the amnesic person suddenly jour - neys from home. This often follows a severe stress, such as marital strife or a natural or human-made disaster. The individual may experience disorientation and a sense of perplexity. Some will assume a new identity and name, and for months may even work at a new occupation. However, in most instances the episode is a brief episode of travel, lasting a few hours or days. Occasionally, there may be outbursts of violence. Recovery is usually sudden, with subsequent amnesia for the episode. Dissociative fugue is another of those extraordinarily interesting, rare disorders\u2014fodder for novels and motion pictures\u2014about which there has been little in the way of recent research. For example, little is known about sex ratio or family history. This is a part of the reason (after its general rarity) that accounts for the demotion of dissociative fugue",
    "extraordinarily interesting, rare disorders\u2014fodder for novels and motion pictures\u2014about which there has been little in the way of recent research. For example, little is known about sex ratio or family history. This is a part of the reason (after its general rarity) that accounts for the demotion of dissociative fugue from an independent diagnosis in DSM-IV to a mere subtype of dissociative amnesia in DSM-5. DSM-5 notes, by the way, that the greatest prevalence of fugue states is among patients with dissociative identity disorder. 240 DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS Essential Features of Dissociative Amnesia Far beyond common forgetfulness, there is a loss of recall for important personal (usually distressing or traumatic) information. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Distress or disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders, cognitive disorders, trauma- and stressor- related disorders, dissociative identity disorder, somatic symp - tom disorder, ordinary forgetfulness) Coding Note If relevant, specify: F44.1 [300.13] With dissociative fugue Holly Kahn A mental health clinician presented the following dilemma to a medical center ethicist. A single 38-year-old woman had been seen several times in the outpatient clinic. She had complained of depression and anxiety, both of which were relatively mild. These symptoms seemed focused on the fact that she was 38 and unmarried, and \u201cher biological clock was ticking.\u201d She had had no problems with sleep, appetite, or weight gain or loss, and had not thought about suicide. For many months Holly Kahn had so longed for a child that she intentionally became pregnant by her boyfriend. When he discovered what she had done, he broke off contact with her. The following week she miscarried. Stuck in her boring, unre - warding job as a sales clerk in a store that specialized in teaching supplies, she said she\u2019d come to the clinic for help in \u201cfinding meaning for her life.\u201d The oldest girl in a Midwestern family, Holly had spent much of her adolescence caring for younger siblings. Although she had attended college for 2 years during her mid-20s, she had come away with neither degree nor career to show for it. In the last decade, she had lived with three different men; her latest relationship had lasted the longest and had seemed the most stable. She had no history of drug abuse or alcoholism and was in good physical health. The clinician\u2019s verbal description was of a plain,",
    "show for it. In the last decade, she had lived with three different men; her latest relationship had lasted the longest and had seemed the most stable. She had no history of drug abuse or alcoholism and was in good physical health. The clinician\u2019s verbal description was of a plain, no longer young (and perhaps never youthful), heavy-set woman with a square jaw and stringy hair. \u201cIn fact, she looks quite a lot like this.\u201d The clinician produced a drawing of a woman\u2019s head and shoulders. It was somewhat indistinct and smudged, but the features did fit the ver - bal description. The ethicist recognized it as a flyer that had recently received wide distribution. The copy below the picture read: \u201cWanted by FBI on suspicion of kidnap- ping.\u201d Dissociative Amnesia 241 A day-old infant had been abducted from a local hospital\u2019s maternity ward. The first-time mother, barely out of her teens, had handed the baby girl to a woman wearing an operating room smock. The woman had introduced herself as a nursing supervisor and said she needed to take the baby for a final weighing and examination before the mother could take her home. That was the last time anyone could remember seeing either the woman or the baby. The picture had been drawn by a police artist from a description given by the distraught mother. A reward was being offered by the baby\u2019s grandparents. \u201cThe next-to-last time I saw my patient, we were trying to work on ways she could take control over her own life. She seemed quite a bit more confident, less depressed. The following week she came in late, looking dazed. She claimed to have no memory of anything she had done for the past several days. I asked her whether she\u2019d been ill, hit on the head, that sort of thing. She denied all of it. I started probing backward to see if I could jog her memory, but she became more and more agitated and finally rushed out. She said she\u2019d return the next week, but I haven\u2019t seen her since. It wasn\u2019t until yesterday that I noticed her resemblance to the woman in this picture.\u201d The therapist sat gazing at the flyer for a few seconds, then said: \u201cHere\u2019s my dilemma. I think I know who committed this really awful crime, but I have a privileged relationship with the person I suspect.",
    "until yesterday that I noticed her resemblance to the woman in this picture.\u201d The therapist sat gazing at the flyer for a few seconds, then said: \u201cHere\u2019s my dilemma. I think I know who committed this really awful crime, but I have a privileged relationship with the person I suspect. Just what is my ethical duty?\u201d Evaluation of Holly Kahn Whether Holly took the baby is not the point here. At issue is the cause of her amnesia, which was her most pressing recent problem (criterion A). She had been under stress because of her desire to have a baby, and this could have provided the stimulus for her amnesia. The episode was itself evidently stressful enough that she broke off contact with her clinician (B). There is no information provided in the vignette that might support other (mostly biological) causes of amnesia (D). Specifically, there was no head trauma that might have induced a major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury. Substance- induced neurocognitive disorder, persistent would be ruled out by Holly\u2019s history of no substance use (C). Her general health had been good and there was no history of abnormal physical movements, reducing the likelihood of epilepsy. Although she had had a miscarriage, too much time had passed for a postabortion psychosis to be a pos- sibility. Some patients with amnesia are also mute; they may be misdiagnosed as having another medical condition with catatonic symptoms. And, just to be complete, we should note that her loss of memory is far more striking and significant than ordinary forgetfulness, which is what we humans experience all the time. There was no history of a recent, massive trauma that might indicate acute stress disorder. If she was malingering , she did it without an obvious motive (had she been trying to avoid punishment for a crime, simply staying away from the medical cen - ter would have served her better). It certainly wouldn\u2019t appear to be a case of normal daydreaming. Holly was clear about her personal identity, and she did not travel from 242 DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS home, so she would not qualify for the dissociative fugue subtype diagnosis. Although we must be careful not to make a diagnosis in a patient we have not personally inter - viewed and for whom we lack adequate collateral information, if what material we do have is borne out by subsequent",
    "so she would not qualify for the dissociative fugue subtype diagnosis. Although we must be careful not to make a diagnosis in a patient we have not personally inter - viewed and for whom we lack adequate collateral information, if what material we do have is borne out by subsequent investigation, her diagnosis would be as below. I\u2019d give her GAF score as 31. F44.0 [300.12] Dissociative amnesia John Doe When the man first walked into the homeless shelter, he hadn\u2019t a thing to his name, including a name. He\u2019d been referred from a hospital emergency room, but he told the clinician on duty that he\u2019d only gone there for a place to stay. As far as he was aware, his physical health was good. His problem was that he didn\u2019t remember a thing about his life prior to waking up on a park bench at dawn that morning. Later, when filling out the paperwork, the clinician had penciled in \u201cJohn Doe\u201d as the patient\u2019s name. Aside from the fact that he could give a history spanning only about 8 hours, John Doe\u2019s mental status exam was remarkably normal. He appeared to be in his early 40s. He was dressed casually in slacks, a pink dress shirt, and a nicely fitting corduroy sports jacket with leather patches on the elbows. His speech was clear and coherent; his affect was generally pleasant, though he was obviously troubled at his loss of memory. He denied having hallucinations or delusions (\u201cas far as I know\u201d), though he pointed out logically enough that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t vouch for what kind of crazy ideas I might have had yesterday.\u201d John Doe appeared intelligent, and his fund of information was good. He could name five recent presidents in order, and he could discuss recent national and interna- tional events. He could repeat eight digits forward and six backwards. He scored 29 out of 30 on the MMSE, failing only to identify the county in which the shelter was located. Although he surmised (he wore a wedding ring) that he must be married, after half an hour\u2019s conversation he could remember nothing pertaining to his family, occupation, place of residence, or personal identity. \u201cLet me look inside your sports jacket,\u201d the clinician said. John Doe looked perplexed, but unbuttoned his jacket and held it open. The label gave the name of a men\u2019s clothing store in Cincinnati, some",
    "he could remember nothing pertaining to his family, occupation, place of residence, or personal identity. \u201cLet me look inside your sports jacket,\u201d the clinician said. John Doe looked perplexed, but unbuttoned his jacket and held it open. The label gave the name of a men\u2019s clothing store in Cincinnati, some 500 miles away. \u201cLet\u2019s try there,\u201d suggested the clinician. Several telephone calls later, the Cincin- nati Police Department identified John Doe as an attorney whose wife had reported him missing 2 days earlier. The following morning John Doe was on a bus for home, but it was days before the clinician heard the rest of the story. A 43-year-old specialist in wills and probate, John Doe had been accused of mingling the bank accounts of clients with his own. He had protested his innocence and hired his own attorney, but the Ohio State Bar Association stood ready to proceed against him. The pressure to straighten out his books, maintain his law practice, and defend himself in court and against his own state bar had been Dissociative Amnesia 243 enormous. Two days before he disappeared, he had told his wife, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can take much more of this without losing my mind.\u201d Evaluation of John Doe John Doe was classically unable to recall important autobiographical information\u2014in fact, all of it (criterion A). It is understandable\u2014and required (B)\u2014that this troubled him. Neither at the time of evaluation nor at follow-up was there evidence of alternative disorders (D). John had not switched repeatedly between identities, which would rule out dissociative identity disorder (you wouldn\u2019t diagnose the two disorders together). Other than obvious amnesia, there was no evidence of a cognitive disorder. At age 43, a new case of temporal lobe epilepsy would be unlikely, but a complete evalua - tion should include a neurological workup. Of course, any patient who has episodes of amnesia must be evaluated for substance- related disorders (especially as concerns alcohol, C). Conscious imitation of amnesia in malingering can be very difficult to discrimi - nate from the amnesia involved in DA with dissociative fugue. However, although John Doe did have legal difficulties, these would not have been relieved by his feigning amnesia. (When malingering appears to be a possibility, collateral history from relatives or friends of previous such behavior or of antisocial personality disorder can help.) A history of lifelong multiple medical symptoms might suggest",
    "although John Doe did have legal difficulties, these would not have been relieved by his feigning amnesia. (When malingering appears to be a possibility, collateral history from relatives or friends of previous such behavior or of antisocial personality disorder can help.) A history of lifelong multiple medical symptoms might suggest somatic symptom disor - der. John had no cross- sectional features that would suggest either a manic episode or schizophrenia, in either of which wandering and other bizarre behaviors can occur. Epilepsy is always mentioned in the differential diagnosis of the dissociative dis - orders. However, epilepsy and dissociation should not be hard to tell apart in practice, even without the benefit of an EEG. Epileptic episodes usually last no longer than a few minutes and involve speech and motor behavior that are repetitive and apparently purposeless. Dissociative behavior, on the other hand, may last for days or longer and involves complex speech and motor behaviors that appear purposeful. Although John Doe\u2019s case is not quite classical (he did not assume a new identity and adopt a new life), he did travel far from home and purposefully set about seeking shelter. That sets up the specifier for his diagnosis. And by the way, his GAF score would be 55. F44.1 [300.13] Dissociative amnesia, with dissociative fugue Z65.3 [V62.5] Investigation by state bar association note that the fugue subtype has a different code number than plain old dissociative amne- sia. This reflects the fact that, in IcD-10 and in IcD-9, a fugue state is a diagnosis separate and apart from dissociative amnesia. So the number change isn\u2019t a mistake. 244 DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS F44.81 [300.14] Dissociative Identity Disorder In dissociative identity disorder (DID), which previously achieved fame as multiple per- sonality disorder, the person possesses at least two distinct identities. Ranging up to 200 in number, these identities may have their own names; they don\u2019t even have to be of the patient\u2019s own gender. Some may be symbolic, such as \u201cThe Worker.\u201d They can vary widely in age and style: If the patient is normally shy and quiet, one identity may be outgoing or even boisterous. The identities may be aware of one another to some degree, though only one interacts with the environment at a time. The transition from one to another is usually sudden, often precipitated by stress. Most of them are aware of the loss of time that",
    "be outgoing or even boisterous. The identities may be aware of one another to some degree, though only one interacts with the environment at a time. The transition from one to another is usually sudden, often precipitated by stress. Most of them are aware of the loss of time that occurs when another identity is in control. However, some patients aren\u2019t aware of their peculiar state until a close friend points out the alterations in character with time. Of particular diagnostic note are states of pathological possession, which can have characteristics similar to DID. They may be characterized by the patient as a spirit or other external being that has taken over the person\u2019s functioning. If this behavior is part of a recognized, accepted religious practice, it will not usually qualify for diagnosis as DID. However, a person who has recurrent possession states that cause distress and otherwise conform to DSM-5 criteria may well qualify for diagnosis. Of course, we would not diagnose DID in a child on the basis of having an imaginary playmate. Affecting up to 1% of the general population, DID is diagnosed much more com - monly by clinicians in North America than in Europe. This fact has engendered a long- running dispute. European clinicians (naturally) claim that the disorder is rare, and that by paying so much attention to patients who dissociate, New World clinicians actually encourage the development of cases. At this writing, the dispute continues unresolved. The onset of this perhaps too- fascinating disorder is usually in childhood, though it is not commonly recognized then. Most of the patients are female, and many may have been sexually abused. DID tends toward chronicity. It may run in families, but the question of genetic transmission is also unresolved. Essential Features of Dissociative Identity Disorder A patient appears to have at least two clearly individual personalities, each with unique attributes of mood, perception, recall, and control of thought and behavior. The result: a person with memory gaps for personal information that common for - getfulness cannot begin to explain.

At age 26\u2014too young for Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014she felt senile on some days. For sev- eral months she had noticed \u201choles in her memory,\u201d which sometimes lasted 2 or 3 days. Her recall wasn\u2019t just spotty; for all she knew about her activities on those days, she might as well have been under anesthesia. However, from telltale signs\u2014such as food that had disappeared from her refrigerator and recently arrived letters that had been opened\u2014she knew she must have been awake and functioning during these times. On the proceeds of the property settlement from her recent divorce, Effie lived alone in a small apartment; her family lived in a distant state. She enjoyed quiet pas - times, such as reading and watching television. She was shy and had trouble meeting people; there was no one she saw often enough to help her account for the missing time. For that matter, Effie wasn\u2019t all that clear about the details of her earlier life. She was the second of three daughters of an itinerant preacher; her early childhood memo- ries were a jumble of labor camps, cheap hotel rooms, and Bible- thumping sermons. By the time she reached age 13, she had attended 15 different schools. Late in the interview, she revealed that she had virtually no memory of the entire year she was 13. Her father\u2019s preaching had been moderately successful, and they had settled for a while in a small town in southern Oregon\u2014the only time she had started and finished a year in the same school. But what had happened to her during the inter- vening months? Of that time, she recalled nothing whatsoever. The following week Effie came back, but she was different. \u201cCall me Liz,\u201d she said as she dropped her shoulder bag onto the floor and leaned back in her chair. Without further prompting, she launched into a long, detailed, and dramatic recounting of her activities of the last 3 days. She had gone out for dinner and dancing with a man she",
    "Liz,\u201d she said as she dropped her shoulder bag onto the floor and leaned back in her chair. Without further prompting, she launched into a long, detailed, and dramatic recounting of her activities of the last 3 days. She had gone out for dinner and dancing with a man she had met in the grocery store, and afterwards they had hit a couple of bars together. \u201cBut I only had ginger ale,\u201d she said, smiling and crossing her legs. \u201cI never drink. It\u2019s terrible for the figure.\u201d \u201cAre there any parts of last week you can\u2019t remember?\u201d \u201cOh, no. She\u2019s the one who has amnesia.\u201d \u201cShe\u201d was Effie Jens, whom Liz clearly regarded as a person quite different from her own self. Liz was happy, carefree, and sociable; Effie was introspective and pre - ferred solitude. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that she isn\u2019t a decent human being,\u201d Liz conceded, \u201cbut you\u2019ve met her\u2014don\u2019t you think she\u2019s just a tad mousy?\u201d Although for many years she had \u201cshared living space\u201d with Effie, it wasn\u2019t until after the divorce that Liz had begun to \u201ccome out,\u201d as she put it. At first this had happened for only an hour or two, especially when Effie was tired or depressed and \u201cneeded a break.\u201d Recently Liz had taken control for longer and longer periods of time; once she had done so for 3 days. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to be careful, it frightens her so,\u201d Liz said with a worried frown. \u201cI\u2019ve begun to think seriously about taking control for all time. I think I can do a better job. I certainly have a better social life.\u201d 246 DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS Besides being able to recount her activities during the blank times that had driven Effie to seek care, Liz could give an eyewitness account of all of Effie\u2019s conscious activi- ties as well. She even knew what had gone on during Effie\u2019s \u201clost\u201d year, when she was 13. \u201cIt was Daddy,\u201d she said with a curl of her lip. \u201cHe said it was part of his reli - gious mission to \u2018practice for a reenactment of the Annunciation.\u2019 But it was really just another randy male groping his own daughter, and worse.

No wonder she\u2019s losing her grip\u2014it even makes me sick.\u201d Evaluation of Effie Jens Effie\u2019s two personalities (criterion A) are fairly typical of DID: One was quiet and unas- suming, almost mousy, whereas the other was much more assertive. (Effie\u2019s history was atypical in that more personalities than two are the rule.) What happened when Liz was in control was unknown to Effie, who experienced these episodes as amnesia. This difficulty with recall was vastly more extensive than you\u2019d expect of common forgetful- ness (B). It was distressing enough to send Effie to the clinic (C). Several other causes of amnesia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this condition. Of course, any possible medical condition must first be ruled out, but Effie/Liz had no history suggestive of either a seizure disorder or substance use (we\u2019re thinking of alcoholic blackouts and partial seizures here). Even though Effie (or Liz) had a significant problem with amnesia, it was not her main problem, as would be the case with dissociative amnesia, which is less often recurrent and does not involve mul- tiple, distinct identities. Note, too, the absence of any information that Effie belonged to a cultural or religious group whose practices included trances or other rituals that could explain her amnesia (D). Schizophrenia has often been confused with DID, primarily by laypeople who equate \u201csplit personality\u201d (which is how many have come to characterize schizophrenia) with multiple personality disorder, the old name for DID. However, although bizarre behavior may be encountered in DID, none of the identities is typically psychotic. As with other dissociative disorders, discrimination from malingering can be difficult; information from others about possible material gain provides the most valuable data. Effie\u2019s history was not typical for either of these diagnoses. Some patients with DID will also have borderline personality disorder. The dan- ger is that only the latter will be diagnosed by a clinician who mistakes alternating personae for the unstable mood and behavior typical of borderline personality disorder.

Here are some examples; a par - ticular condition should be stated after the other specified diagnosis is given. Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion. People who have been brainwashed or otherwise indoctrinated may develop mixed dis - sociative states. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events. DSM-5 mentions that these often last just a few hours, though less than a month, and are characterized by mixed dissociative symptoms (depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, disruptions of consciousness, stupor). Dissociative trance. Here the person loses focus on the here and now, and may behave automatically. (A person\u2019s engaging in an accepted religious or cultural ritual would not qualify as an example of dissociative trance.) F44.9 [V300.15] Unspecified Dissociative Disorder This diagnosis will serve to categorize those patients for whom there are evident disso- ciative symptoms, but who don\u2019t fulfill criteria for any of the standard diagnoses already mentioned above, and for whom you do not care to specify the reasons why the criteria are not fulfilled. 248 DISSOCIATIVE DISO rDErS 249 CHAPTEr 8 Somatic Symptom and related Disorders Quick Guide to the Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders When somatic (body) symptoms are a prominent reason for evaluation by a clinician, the diagnosis will often be one of the disorders (or categories) listed below. As usual, the page number following each item indicates where a more detailed discussion begins. Primary Somatic Symptom Disorders Somatic symptom disorder. Formerly called somatization disorder, this chronic condition is characterized by unexplained physical symptoms. It is found almost exclusively in women (p. 251). Somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain. The pain in question has no apparent physical or physiological basis, or it far exceeds the usual expectations, given the patient\u2019s actual physical condition (p.",
    "disorder, this chronic condition is characterized by unexplained physical symptoms. It is found almost exclusively in women (p. 251). Somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain. The pain in question has no apparent physical or physiological basis, or it far exceeds the usual expectations, given the patient\u2019s actual physical condition (p. 257). Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). These patients complain of isolated symptoms that seem to have no physical cause (p. 262). Illness anxiety disorder. Formerly called hypochondriasis, this is a disorder in which physi - cally healthy people have an unfounded fear of a serious, often life- threatening illness such as cancer or heart disease\u2014but little in the way of somatic symptoms (p. 260). Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions. A patient\u2019s mental or emotional issues influence the course or care of a medical disorder (p. 266). Factitious disorder imposed on self. Patients who want to occupy the sick role (perhaps they enjoy the attention of being in a hospital) consciously fabricate symptoms to attract atten- tion from health care professionals (p. 268). Factitious disorder imposed on another. A person induces symptoms in someone else, often a child, possibly for the purpose of gaining attention (p. 269). Other specified, or unspecified, somatic symptom and related disorder. These are catch-all categories for patients whose somatic symptoms fail to meet criteria for any better- defined disorder (p. 275). Other Causes of Somatic Complaints Actual physical illness. Psychological causes for physical symptoms should be considered only after physical disorders have been eliminated. Mood disorders. Pain with no apparent physical cause is characteristic of some patients with major depressive disorder (p. 122) and bipolar I disorder, current or most recent episode depressed (p. 129). Because they are treatable and potentially life- threatening, these pos- sibilities must be investigated early. Substance use. Patients who use substances may complain of pain or other physical symp - toms. These may result from the effects of substance intoxication (p. 411) or withdrawal (p. 402). Adjustment disorder. Some patients who are experiencing a reaction to environmental cir- cumstances will complain of pain or other somatic symptoms (p. 228). Malingering. These patients know that their somatic (or psychological) symptoms are fabri- cated, and their motive is some form of material gain, such as avoiding punishment or work, or obtaining money or drugs (p. 599).

    "Malingering. These patients know that their somatic (or psychological) symptoms are fabri- cated, and their motive is some form of material gain, such as avoiding punishment or work, or obtaining money or drugs (p. 599). Introduction For centuries, clinicians have recognized that physical symptoms and concerns about health can have emotional origins. DSM-III and its successors have gathered several alternatives to organic diagnoses under one umbrella. Collectively, these are now called the somatic symptom and related disorders, because their presentations resemble somatic (bodily) disease. Like so many other groups of disorders discussed in this book, these conditions are not bound together by common etiologies, family histories, treat - ments, or other factors. This chapter is simply another convenient collection\u2014in this case, of conditions that are concerned primarily with physical symptoms. 250 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS Several sorts of problems can suggest somatic symptom disorder. These include the following: \u2022\u2022 Pain that is excessive or chronic \u2022\u2022 Conversion symptoms (see sidebar below) \u2022\u2022 Chronic, multiple symptoms that seem to lack an adequate explanation \u2022\u2022 Complaints that don\u2019t improve, despite treatment that helps most patients \u2022\u2022 Excessive concern with health or body appearance Patients with somatic symptom and related disorders have usually been evaluated (perhaps many times) for physical illness. These evaluations often lead to testing and treatments that are expensive, time- consuming, ineffective, and sometimes dangerous. The result of such treatment may be only to reinforce the patients\u2019 fearful belief in some nonexistent medical illness. At some point, health care personnel recognize that what- ever is wrong has strong emotional underpinnings, and refer these patients for mental health evaluation. It is important to acknowledge that, with the obvious exception of factitious dis - order, these patients are not faking their symptoms. Rather, they often believe that they have something seriously wrong; this belief can cause them enormous anxiety and impairment. Without meaning to, they inflict great suffering on themselves and on those around them. On the other hand, we must also remember that the mere presence of a somatic symptom disorder does not ensure against the subsequent development of another medical condition. These patients can also develop other forms of mental disturbance. F45.1 [300.82] Somatic Symptom Disorder The DSM-5 criteria for somatic symptom disorder (SSD) require only a single somatic symptom, but it must cause distress or markedly impair the patient\u2019s functioning. None- theless, the classical patient has a",
    "another medical condition. These patients can also develop other forms of mental disturbance. F45.1 [300.82] Somatic Symptom Disorder The DSM-5 criteria for somatic symptom disorder (SSD) require only a single somatic symptom, but it must cause distress or markedly impair the patient\u2019s functioning. None- theless, the classical patient has a pattern of multiple physical and emotional symptoms that can affect various (often many) areas of the body, including pain symptoms, prob - lems with breathing or heartbeat, abdominal complaints, and/or menstrual disorders. Of course, conversion symptoms (body dysfunctioning such as paralysis or blindness that has no anatomical or physiological cause) may also be encountered. Treatment that usually helps symptoms that are caused by actual physical disease is usually ineffective in the long run for these patients. SSD* begins early in life, usually in the teens or early 20s, and can last for many *Much of the information presented here and elsewhere in this chapter is based on studies of patients defined by DSM-IV criteria. When DSM-5 criteria were written, there simply weren\u2019t data available for disorders defined by the new criteria. Somatic Symptom Disorder 251 years\u2014 perhaps the patient\u2019s entire lifetime. Often overlooked by health care profes - sionals, this condition affects about 1% of all women; it occurs less often in men, though the actual ratio is unknown, considering that the definition of SSD has only just been written. SSD may account for 7\u20138% of mental health clinic patients and perhaps nearly that percentage of hospitalized mental health patients. It has a strong tendency to run in families. Transmission is probably both genetic and environmental; SSD may be more frequent in patients with low socioeconomic status and less education. Half or more of patients with SSD have anxiety and mood symptoms. There is an ever- present danger that clinicians will diagnose an anxiety or mood disorder and ignore the underlying SSD. Then the all-too- common result is that the patient receives treatment specific for the mood or anxiety disorder, rather than an approach that might actually address the underlying SSD. Essential Features of Somatic Symptom Disorder Concern about one or more somatic symptoms leads the patient to express a high level of health anxiety by investing excessive time in health care or being excessively worried as to the seriousness of symptoms.

One of these behaviors. Moderate. 2+.

Hys- teria was created over 2,000 years ago by the Greeks, who famously believed that its symptoms arose from a uterus that wandered throughout the body, producing pain or stop- ping the breath or clogging the throat. That ancient term remained in use until the middle of the 20th century, when it received a new label and a more complicated definition. Briquet syndrome was coined to honor the 19th- century French physician who first described the disorder\u2019s typical polysymptomatic presentation. For diagnosis, it required 25 symptoms (of a possible 60), each of which the clinician had to determine to be unsub- stantiated by physical or laboratory examination. The list included pseudoneurological symptoms (such as temporary blindness and aphonia), but also emotional symptoms such as depression, anxiety attacks, and hallucinations\u2014plus a lot more. Twenty-five symptoms were just too many for some clinicians. In 1980, the authors of DSM-III devised the term somatization disorder to highlight new criteria that reduced the number of symptoms, along the way discarding all the mental and emotional symptoms from the b riquet symptoms list. DSM-III-R and DSM-IV further redefined and shortened the list (\u201cdumbed it down,\u201d some would say). The b riquet symptoms yielded excellent results in terms of isolating a group of patients who later did not turn out to have actual physical disease and who responded well to psychological and behavioral treatment. Even with the",

The b riquet symptoms yielded excellent results in terms of isolating a group of patients who later did not turn out to have actual physical disease and who responded well to psychological and behavioral treatment. Even with the simpler somatization disorder symptoms, however, few patients were ever diag - nosed; perhaps clinicians didn\u2019t want to take the trouble, or perhaps the symptoms were simply too restrictive for practical purposes. now, with SSD, we are back where we started: a single symptom, attended by a certain degree of concern on the part of the patient, will suffice for a DSM-5 diagnosis. It is note - worthy that as the names have progressively lengthened, the criteria sets have been getting shorter\u2014with the obvious exception of hysteria itself, which was a seat-of-the-pants diagno- sis that entailed identifying but a single symptom, often of the pseudoneurological \u201cconver- sion\u201d type. It remains to be seen how well the DSM-5 criteria for SSD will discriminate these patients from those with other diagnoses in the somatic symptoms and related disorders group, and from patients with physical illness. but I fear that we really may have truly come full circle, to the point where we are once again in danger of misidentifying people whose symp- toms are perplexing, even mysterious, but which may well presage ultimate physical disease. There\u2019s one other issue that deserves our scrutiny: n owhere do the DSM-5 criteria require that other causes of the patient\u2019s symptoms be ruled out. That places the SSD criteria in select company (intellectual disability, personality disorders, substance use dis- orders, anorexia nervosa, and the paraphilic disorders) as requiring no consideration of a differential diagnosis. Here\u2019s the bottom line. I can indeed make this part of DSM-5 truly easy: Don\u2019t use it! Until the data are in that persuade me SSD is a useful concept that promotes the well- being of my patients, I will personally continue to use either the old DSM-IV somatization disorder guidelines (see the next sidebar, p. 256) or the even older b riquet syndrome criteria. and here\u2019s my guarantee: any patient diagnosed by either of these standards will also qualify for a diagnosis of DSM-5 SSD.

Somatic Symptom Disorder 253 Cynthia Fowler When Cynthia Fowler told her story, she cried. At age 35, she was talking with the most recent in her series of health care professionals. Her history was a complicated one; it began in her mid-teens with arthritis that seemed to move from one joint to another. She had been told that these were \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but the symptoms had continued to come and go over the intervening 20 years. Although she was subsequently diagnosed as having various types of arthritis, laboratory tests never substantiated any of them. A long succession of treatments had proven fruitless. In her mid-20s, Cynthia was evaluated for left flank pain, but again nothing was found. Later, abdominal pain and vomiting spells were worked up with gastroscopy and barium X-rays. Each of these studies was normal. A histamine antagonist was added to her growing list of medications, which by now included various anti- inflammatory agents, as well as prescription and over-the- counter analgesics. Cynthia had thought at one time that many of her symptoms were aggravated by her premenstrual syndrome, which she had recognized in herself after reading about it in a women\u2019s magazine. She had invariably been irritable with cramps before her period, which used to be so heavy that she would sometimes stay in bed for several days. When she was 26, therefore, she\u2019d had a total hysterectomy. Six months later, per- sistent vomiting led to endoscopy; other than adhesions, no abnormalities were found. Alternating diarrhea and constipation then caused her to experiment with a series of preparations to regulate her bowel movements. When she was questioned about sex, Cynthia shifted uncomfortably in her chair. She didn\u2019t care much for it and had never experienced a climax. Her lack of interest was no problem to her, though each of her three husbands had complained a lot. When she was a young teenager, something sexual might have happened to her, she finally admitted, but that was a part of her life she really couldn\u2019t recall. \u201cIt\u2019s as if someone cut a whole year out of my diary,\u201d she explained. When she was 2 and her brother was 6 months old, Cynthia\u2019s father had deserted the family. Her mother subsequently worked as a waitress and lived",
    "was a part of her life she really couldn\u2019t recall. \u201cIt\u2019s as if someone cut a whole year out of my diary,\u201d she explained. When she was 2 and her brother was 6 months old, Cynthia\u2019s father had deserted the family. Her mother subsequently worked as a waitress and lived with a succession of men, some of whom she married. When Cynthia was 12, her mother escaped from one of Cynthia\u2019s stepfathers; she then placed the two children in foster care. One way or another, each of Cynthia\u2019s former clinicians had disappointed her. \u201cNone of the others knew how to help me. But I just know you\u2019ll find out what\u2019s wrong. Everyone says you\u2019re the best in town.\u201d Through her tears, she managed a confident smile. Evaluation of Cynthia Fowler At a glance, we can affirm that Cynthia had distressing somatic symptoms (criterion A) that for years (C) had occupied a great deal of time and effort (B). That, in essence, earns her a DSM-5 diagnosis of SSD. However, I\u2019d prefer to analyze her condition in light of the old DSM-IV somatization disorder guidelines (again, see the sidebar, p. 256). Cynthia needed to have at least eight symptoms across the four symptom areas, 254 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS and she did: pain (abdominal, flank, joint, and menstrual); gastrointestinal (diarrhea, vomiting); sexual (excessive menstrual bleeding, sexual indifference); and a lone pseu - doneurological symptom (amnesia). The DSM-IV criteria require that these symptoms not be explainable on the basis of physical disease, and that they impair the patient\u2019s functioning in some way\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get much disagreement there, either. They started well before she turned 30, and there is nothing to suggest that she was inten - tionally feigning them. Q.E.D. Even so, as with nearly every mental disorder, another medical condition is the first possibility that I would seek to rule out. Among the medical and neurological dis - orders to consider are multiple sclerosis, spinal cord tumors, and diseases of the heart and lungs. Cynthia had already been worked up for a variety of medical conditions and had been prescribed multiple medications, none of which had done her much good. Judging by the last paragraph of the vignette, her previous clinicians might have been at a loss to diagnose or treat her effectively. Setting Cynthia\u2019s experience apart from patients with actual physical disease are (1) the number",
    "had been prescribed multiple medications, none of which had done her much good. Judging by the last paragraph of the vignette, her previous clinicians might have been at a loss to diagnose or treat her effectively. Setting Cynthia\u2019s experience apart from patients with actual physical disease are (1) the number and variety of the symptoms (though neither is required by SSD crite - rion A); (2) the absence of an adequate explanation for the symptoms based on history, lab findings, or physical examination; and (3) inadequate relief from treatments that are ordinarily helpful for the symptoms in question. Note once again that although the SSD criteria allow a diagnosis based on far fewer symptoms than Cynthia had, her his- tory is typical of a group of patients whom clinicians have been attempting to help for millennia. Certain other somatic symptom and related disorders require discussion. In SSD with predominant pain, the patient focuses on severe, sometimes incapacitating somatic pain. Although Cynthia complained of pain in a variety of locations, it was only one aspect of a much broader picture of somatic illness. Patients with illness anxiety disorder (formerly hypochondriasis) can have multiple physical symptoms, but their concern focuses on the fear of having a specific physical disease, not, as with Cynthia, particular symptoms. Cynthia did not have any classical physical conversion symptoms (e.g., stocking or glove anesthesia, hemiparalysis), but many patients with SSD do. Then conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) enters the differ - ential diagnosis. However, as with SSD with predominant pain, conversion disorder should not be diagnosed in any patient who fulfills criteria for the more encompass - ing SSD. In addition, Cynthia\u2019s amnesia might qualify for the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia if it were the predominant problem. You should always inquire carefully about substance- related disorders, which are found in one- quarter or more of patients with SSD. And when patients come to the attention of mental health providers, it is often because of a concomitant mood disorder or anxiety disorder. Many patients with SSD also have one or more personality disorders. Especially prevalent is histrionic personality disorder, though borderline and antisocial personal- ity disorders may also be diagnosed. Cynthia\u2019s words to the clinician in the last para - graph suggest a personality disorder, but with insufficient information, I\u2019d defer that Somatic Symptom Disorder 255 diagnosis for now.

With a GAF score of 61, Cynthia\u2019s current diagnosis would read as follows: F45.1 [300.82] Somatic symptom disorder Here\u2019s an outline of the DSM-IV somatization disorder (SD): \u2022\u2022 From an early age, these patients have numerous physical complaints that wax and wane, with new ones often beginning as old ones resolve. With treatment typi- cally ineffective, patients tend to switch health care providers in search of cure. \u2022\u2022 The wide variety of possible symptoms fall into several groups. \u2022\u2022 Pain (several different sites are required): in the head, back, chest, abdomen, joints, arms or legs, or genitals; or related to body functions, such as urination, menstruation, or sexual intercourse \u2022\u2022 Gastrointestinal (other than pain): bloating, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting spells (except during pregnancy), or intolerance of several foods (nominally, three or more) \u2022\u2022 Sexual or reproductive systems (other than pain): difficulty with erection or ejaculation, irregular menses, excessive menstrual flow, or vomiting that per- sists throughout pregnancy \u2022\u2022 Pseudoneurological (not pain): blindness, deafness, double vision, lump in throat or trouble swallowing, inability to speak, poor balance or coordination, weak or paralyzed muscles, retention of urine, hallucinations, numbness to touch or pain, seizures, amnesia (or any other dissociative symptom), or loss of consciousness (other than fainting) \u2022\u2022 The typical patient will have eight or more symptoms, with four (or more) from the pain group, two from the gastrointestinal group, and at least one each from the other two groups. Most patients will have far more symptoms than eight. Symp - toms require treatment or impair social, personal, or occupational functioning. \u2022\u2022 DSM-IV required an onset by age 30, but most patients have been ill from their teens or early 20s on. SD symptoms must be unexplained by any medical condi- tion (including substance misuse). Patients who also have actual physical illnesses often react to them with greater anxiety than you might expect. \u2022\u2022 Of course, actual physical illness should be first on the list of differential diagno - ses. and, because SD can be difficult to treat,",

Patients who also have actual physical illnesses often react to them with greater anxiety than you might expect. \u2022\u2022 Of course, actual physical illness should be first on the list of differential diagno - ses. and, because SD can be difficult to treat, there are many other mental and emotional disorders that need to be ruled out. These include mood or anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, and dissociative or stress disorders. Substance use disorders can be comorbid with SD. I would include factitious disorder and malingering on the differential list, but these belong very near the bottom. 256 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS With Predominant Pain Specifier for Somatic Symptom Disorder Some patients with SSD experience mainly pain, in which case the specifier with pre - dominant pain is indicated. DSM-IV called it pain disorder, an independent condition with its own criteria. (From here on, I refer to it as SSD\u2013Pain.) Whatever we call it, we need to keep in mind these facts: \u2022\u2022 Pain is subjective\u2014 individuals experience it differently. \u2022\u2022 There is no gross anatomical pathology. \u2022\u2022 Measuring pain is hard. So it\u2019s hard to know that a patient who complains of chronic or excruciating pain, and apparently lacks adequate objective pathology, has a mental disorder at all. (In DSM- 5, patients who have actual pain but show excessive concern can be diagnosed with SSD\u2013Pain.) The pain in question is usually chronic and often severe. It can take many forms, but especially common is pain in the lower back, head, pelvis, or temporomandibular joint. Typically, SSD\u2013Pain doesn\u2019t wax and wane with time and doesn\u2019t diminish with distraction; it may respond only poorly to analgesics, if at all. Chronic pain interferes with cognition, causing people to have trouble with mem- ory, concentration, and completing tasks. It is often associated with depression, anxi - ety, and low self- esteem; sleep may be disturbed. Such patients may experience slower response to stimuli; fear of worsening pain may reduce their physical activity. Of course, work suffers. In over half the cases, chronic pain is managed inadequately by clinicians. SSD\u2013Pain usually begins in the 30s or 40s, often following an accident or some other physical illness. It is more often diagnosed in women than in men. As its duration extends, it often leads to increasing incapacity for work and social life, and sometimes to complete invalidism.",
    "inadequately by clinicians. SSD\u2013Pain usually begins in the 30s or 40s, often following an accident or some other physical illness. It is more often diagnosed in women than in men. As its duration extends, it often leads to increasing incapacity for work and social life, and sometimes to complete invalidism. Although some form of pain affects many adults in the general population\u2014 perhaps as high as 30% in the United States\u2014no one knows for sure the prevalence of SSD\u2013Pain. Ruby Bissell Ruby Bissell placed a hand on each chair arm and shifted uncomfortably. She had been talking for nearly half an hour, and the dull, constant ache had worsened. Pushing up with both hands, she hoisted herself to her feet. She winced as she pressed a fist into the small of her back; the furrows on her face added a decade to her 45 years. Although Ruby had had this problem for nearly 6 years, she wasn\u2019t sure exactly when it began. It could have started when she helped to move a patient from the oper- ating table to a gurney. But the first orthopedist she ever consulted explained that her pulled ligament was mild, so she continued to work as an operating room nurse for nearly a year. Her back hurt whether she was sitting or standing, so she\u2019d had to resign With Predominant Pain Specifier for Somatic Symptom Disorder 257 from her job; she couldn\u2019t maintain any physical position longer than a few minutes at a time. \u201cThey let me do supervisory work for a while,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I had to quit that, too. My only choices were sitting or standing, and I have to spend part of each hour flat on my back.\u201d From her solidly blue- collar parents, Ruby had inherited a work ethic. She\u2019d sup- ported herself from the age of 17, so her forced retirement had been a blow. But she couldn\u2019t say she felt depressed about it. In fact, she had never been very introspective about her feelings and couldn\u2019t really explain how she felt about many things. She did deny ever having hallucinations or delusions; aside from her back pain, her physical health had been good. Although she occasionally awakened at night with back pain, she had no real insomnia; appetite and weight had been normal. When the interviewer asked whether she had ever had death wishes or suicidal ideas, she",

Although she occasionally awakened at night with back pain, she had no real insomnia; appetite and weight had been normal. When the interviewer asked whether she had ever had death wishes or suicidal ideas, she was a little offended and strongly denied them. A variety of treatments had made little difference in Ruby\u2019s condition. Pain medi- cation provided almost no relief at all, and she had quit them all before she could get hooked. Physical therapy made her hurt all the more, and an electrical stimulation unit seemed to burn her skin. A neurosurgeon had found no anatomical pathology and explained to Ruby that a laminectomy and spinal fusion were unlikely to improve matters. Her own husband\u2019s experience had caused her to distrust any surgical intervention. He had been injured in a trucking accident a year before her own difficulty began; his subsequent laminectomy had left him not only disabled for work, but impotent. With no children to support, the two lived in reasonable comfort on their combined disability incomes. \u201cMostly we just stay at home,\u201d Ruby remarked. \u201cWe care a lot for each other. Our relationship is the one part of my life that\u2019s really good.\u201d The interviewer asked whether they were still able to have any sort of a sex life. Ruby admitted that they did not. \u201cWe used to be very active, and I enjoyed it a lot. After his accident, and he couldn\u2019t perform, Gregory felt terribly guilty that he couldn\u2019t satisfy me. Now my back pain would keep me from having sex, regardless. It\u2019s almost a relief that he doesn\u2019t have to bear all the responsibility.\u201d Evaluation of Ruby Bissell For several years (far longer than the 6 months required by SSD criterion C), Ruby had complained of severe pain (A) that had markedly affected her life, especially her ability to work. She had clearly spent a great deal of time and effort (B) trying to manage her pain. There, in a nutshell, we\u2019ve covered the three requirements for SSD\u2013Pain. Although the criteria don\u2019t require us to rule out other causes, we\u2019re responsible clinicians, so of course we will do so anyway. Principally, we need to know that her pain wasn\u2019t caused by another medical condition. The vignette makes clear that she had been thoroughly evaluated by her orthopedist, who",
    "Although the criteria don\u2019t require us to rule out other causes, we\u2019re responsible clinicians, so of course we will do so anyway. Principally, we need to know that her pain wasn\u2019t caused by another medical condition. The vignette makes clear that she had been thoroughly evaluated by her orthopedist, who determined that she did not have 258 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS pathology adequate to account for the severity of her symptoms. (Even if she did have some defined pathology, SSD\u2013Pain might also be suspected if the distribution, timing, or description of the pain was atypical of a physical illness.) Could Ruby have been malingering? This question is especially relevant to any - one who receives compensation for a work- related injury. However, Ruby\u2019s suffering seemed genuine, and the vignette gives no indication that she was physically more able- bodied at leisure that at work. Her referral had not been made within a legal context, and she cooperated fully with the examination. Furthermore, malingering would not seem consistent with her long-held work ethic. Pain is often a symptom of depression ; indeed, many practitioners will automati - cally recommend a course of antidepressant medication for nearly anyone who com - plains of severe or chronic pain. Although Ruby denied feeling especially depressed, her pain symptoms could still be a stand-in for a mood disorder. But she had no suicidal ideas, disturbance of sleep, or disturbance of appetite that would support such a diag - nosis. Although patients with substance- related disorders will sometimes fabricate (or imagine) pain in order to obtain medications, Ruby had been careful to avoid becoming dependent on analgesics. Several other somatic symptom disorders should be briefly considered. People with illness anxiety disorder tend to have symptoms other than pain, and they fluc - tuate with time. Pain is not a symptom typical of conversion disorder. People with adjustment disorder will sometimes have physical symptoms, but such conditions are associated with identifiable precipitants and disappear with the stressor. DSM-5 doesn\u2019t require us to identify psychological factors that could underlie pain. Indeed, the presumption that there be a psychological mechanism is no longer a criterion for SSD. It is useful, however, to think about possible psychological factors that could contribute to the production or maintenance of a given patient\u2019s pain experi- ence. Ruby\u2019s history includes several such possibilities. These included her perception of her husband\u2019s feeling about",
    "a psychological mechanism is no longer a criterion for SSD. It is useful, however, to think about possible psychological factors that could contribute to the production or maintenance of a given patient\u2019s pain experi- ence. Ruby\u2019s history includes several such possibilities. These included her perception of her husband\u2019s feeling about his impotence, her anxiety at being left as the sole bread- winner, and possibly her own resentment at having worked since she was a teenager. (Many patients have multiple psychological considerations.) Psychological factors that might be causing or worsening Ruby\u2019s pain thus include stress resulting from relationships, work, and finances. With her GAF score of 61, her diagnosis would be as follows: F45.1 [300.82] Somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain Z65.8 [V62.89] Health problems and disability in husband an occasional patient like Ruby will be completely unable to describe the emotional com- ponent of pain. The inability to verbalize the emotions one feels has been termed alexi- thymia, Greek for \u201cwithout expression of mood.\u201d With Predominant Pain Specifier for Somatic Symptom Disorder 259 F45.21 [300.7] Illness Anxiety Disorder People with illness anxiety disorder (IAD) are terribly worried that they might have a serious illness. Their anxiety persists despite medical evidence to the contrary and reassurance from health care professionals. Common examples include fear of heart disease (which might start with an occasional heart palpitation) and of cancer (ever wonder about that mole\u2014it seems to have darkened a bit?). These patients are not psy- chotic: They may agree temporarily that their symptoms could be emotional in origin, though they quickly revert to their fearful obsessing. Then they reject any suggestion that they do not have physical disease, and may even become outraged and refuse men- tal health consultation. Many such patients have physical symptoms that would qualify them for somatic symptom disorder, as just discussed. However, about a quarter of such patients have all the concern about being sick, but not much in the way of somatic symptoms. Occa- sionally patients will have demonstrable organic disease, but their hypochondriacal symptoms are out of proportion to the seriousness of the actual medical condition. To delineate these patients more clearly, the condition has been renamed ( hypochondria is considered pejorative), and new criteria have been written. Though known for centuries, IAD still hasn\u2019t been carefully studied; for example, it isn\u2019t even known whether it runs in families. By all accounts, however, it is",
    "condition. To delineate these patients more clearly, the condition has been renamed ( hypochondria is considered pejorative), and new criteria have been written. Though known for centuries, IAD still hasn\u2019t been carefully studied; for example, it isn\u2019t even known whether it runs in families. By all accounts, however, it is fairly common (perhaps 5% of the general population), especially in the offices of non- mental health practitioners. It tends to begin in the 20s or 30s, with peak prevalence at about 30 or 40. It is probably about equally frequent in men and women. Although they do not have high rates of current medical illnesses, such patients report a high prevalence of childhood illness. Historically, hypochondriasis has been a source of fun for cartoonists and play - wrights (read Moli\u00e8re\u2019s The Imaginary Invalid), but in reality the disorder causes gen- uine misery. Although it can resolve completely, it more often runs a chronic course, for years interfering with work and social life. Many patients go from doctor to doctor in the effort to find someone who will relieve them of the serious disorders they feel sure they have; for a few, like Moli\u00e8re\u2019s poor creature, Argan, it leads to complete invalidism. Essential Features of Illness Anxiety Disorder Despite the absence of serious physical symptoms, the patient is inordinately con - cerned about being ill. High anxiety coupled with a low threshold for alarm yields recurring behaviors concerning health (seeking reassurance, checking over and over for physical signs). Some patients cope instead by avoiding hospitals and medical appointments. 260 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (6+ months, though the concerns may vary) \u2022 Differential diag- nosis (substance use and physical disorders, mood or anxiety disorders, psychotic or stress disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, somatic symptom disorder) Coding Notes Specify subtype: Care- seeking type.

Years ago, he\u2019d started attending a college several hundred miles away. After only a semester, he\u2019d moved back home. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be that far from my doctors,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to prevent heart disease, you can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d With a practiced hand, he adjusted the blood pressure cuff around his upper arm. When Julian was a young teenager, his dad had died. \u201cHis death was self- inflicted,\u201d Julian pointed out. \u201cHe\u2019d had rheumatic fever as a child, which gave him an enlarged heart. And the only thing he ever exercised was his right to eat anything fried, includ - ing Twinkies. And he smoked\u2014he was a proud two-pack-a-day man. Look where that got him.\u201d None of these health risks applied to Julian, who was nothing if not careful about what he put into his body. He had spent hours searching the Internet for information on diet, and he\u2019d attended a lecture by Dean Ornish. \u201cI\u2019ve followed a plant-based diet ever since,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI\u2019m especially keen on tofu. And broccoli.\u201d Julian had never complained much of symptoms\u2014just the odd palpitation, maybe \u201chot flushes\u201d on an especially humid day. \u201cI don\u2019t feel bad,\u201d he explained. \u201cI just feel scared.\u201d This time, he\u2019d heard a report on NPR about young people with heart disease. It had startled him so much he\u2019d dropped the dish he had been putting into the cupboard. Without even cleaning up the mess, he caught the next bus to the ER. Julian agreed that he needed a different approach to his health care needs, and thought he might be willing to give cognitive- behavioral therapy a try. \u201cBut first,\u201d he asked, \u201ccould you check my blood pressure just once more?\u201d Illness Anxiety Disorder 261 Evaluation of Julian Fenster The requirements for IAD are not onerous; Julian met them handily. He had a dispro- portionate concern for a condition he had been assured he did not have (criterion A). He had both high anxiety and a low threshold for alarm (it took only a report on the radio to frighten him into the ER once again, C).

    "have (criterion A). He had both high anxiety and a low threshold for alarm (it took only a report on the radio to frighten him into the ER once again, C). His actual symptoms weren\u2019t just mild\u2014 they were pretty much nonexistent (B)\u2014so we can rule out somatic symptom disorder. He invested huge amounts of time in trolling the Internet for health information (D). Finally, he had had these symptoms far longer than the 6-month minimum required (E) for the diagnosis of IAD. As with any other condition discussed in this chapter (other than the disparaged [by me] somatic symptom disorder), the first issue on our list to rule out is another medical condition: Marked, if not inordinate, health anxiety is pretty common in med- ical outpatients. Physical illnesses can be easy to miss, especially if the patient has had a long history of complaints that seem without physical basis. However, Julian\u2019s symptoms had been evaluated over and again, to the point that there was little danger anything had been missed. Still, even people with hypochondriacal behavior are not immortal, so physical disorders would remain a significant rule-out that his clinicians must always keep in mind. Anxious concern about health can occur in other mental disorders, but we can find some differences to help discriminate. Among these are body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety and related disorders (for example, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disor- der, and obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder). Julian had no symptoms suggesting any of these. When somatic concerns emerge in schizophrenia, they tend to be delusional and bizarre (\u201cMy brain is turning to bread\u201d). In major depressive disorder , they are ego- syntonic but may be influenced by melancholia (\u201cMy bowels have turned to cement\u201d). As keen as I am on looking for depression in almost every mental health patient, I don\u2019t see depressive symptoms here. I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 65. The girth of Julian\u2019s chart would support the care- seeking subtype specifier. F45.21 [300.7] Illness anxiety disorder, care- seeking type Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) Let\u2019s define a conversion symptom as (1) a change in how the body functions when (2) no causative physical or physiological malfunctioning can be found. These symptoms are often termed pseudoneurological , and they include both sensory and motor symp- toms\u2014with or without impaired consciousness.

    "in how the body functions when (2) no causative physical or physiological malfunctioning can be found. These symptoms are often termed pseudoneurological , and they include both sensory and motor symp- toms\u2014with or without impaired consciousness. Conversion symptoms usually don\u2019t conform to the anatomical pattern we\u2019d expect for a condition with a well- defined physical cause. An example would be a stocking anesthesia, in which the patient complains of numbness of the foot that ends abruptly in a line encircling the lower leg. The actual pattern of nerve supply to the foot is quite dif- ferent; it would not occasion numbness defined by such a neat line. Other examples of 262 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS sensory conversion symptoms include blindness, deafness, double vision, and halluci - nations. Examples of motor deficits that are conversion symptoms include impaired bal- ance or staggering gait (at one time called astasia- abasia), weak or paralyzed muscles, lump in throat or trouble swallowing, loss of voice, and retention of urine. For decades, criteria for conversion disorder required the clinician to judge that causation by an emotional conflict or specific psychological stress cause the conversion symptom (for example, a man develops blindness after finding his wife in bed with a neighbor). DSM-5 has abandoned this requirement, in view of the potential for dis - agreement as to causation: One clinician may see a \u201ccausal link\u201d between nearly any two events, while another strenuously argues against any such connection. Conversion symptoms occur widely, throughout various medical populations; up to one-third of adults have had at least one such symptom lifetime. However, conversion dis- order is rarely diagnosed in mental health patients\u2014 perhaps in only 1 of 10,000. It is usu- ally a disorder of young people and is probably far more common among women than men. It is somewhat more likely to be found in patients who are undereducated and medically unsophisticated, and who live where medical practice and diagnosis are still emerging. It may be diagnosed more often among patients seen in consultation in a general hospital. Note that the criteria don\u2019t require patients to undergo laboratory or imaging tests. The requirement is only that, after a careful physical and neurological evaluation, the patient\u2019s symptom cannot be explained by a known medical or neurological disease process. The stocking anesthesia I have mentioned above would fill that requirement; so would total blindness in a patient",
    "to undergo laboratory or imaging tests. The requirement is only that, after a careful physical and neurological evaluation, the patient\u2019s symptom cannot be explained by a known medical or neurological disease process. The stocking anesthesia I have mentioned above would fill that requirement; so would total blindness in a patient whose pupils constrict in response to a bright light. There is a rich and entertaining literature of clinical tests for pseudoneurological symptoms. Having a conversion symptom may not allow meaningful predictions about a patient\u2019s future course. Follow-up studies find that many people who have had a con - version symptom do not have a mental disorder. Years later, many are well, with no physical or mental disorders. Some have somatization (or somatic symptom) disorder or another mental disorder. A few turn out to have an actual physical (sometimes neu - rological) illness, including brain or spinal cord tumors, multiple sclerosis, or a vari - ety of other medical and neurological disorders. Although clinicians have undoubtedly improved in their ability to discriminate conversion symptoms from \u201creal disease,\u201d it remains distressingly easy to make mistakes. Essential Features of Conversion Disorder The patient\u2019s symptom or symptoms\u2014 changes in sensory or voluntary motor func - tioning\u2014seem clinically inconsistent with any known medical illness. The Fine Print A \u201cnormal\u201d exam or a bizarre test result isn\u2019t enough to affirm the diagnosis; there must be positive supportive evidence. Such evidence would include a change in find- Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) 263 ings from positive to negative when a different test is used (or the patient is dis - tracted), or impossible findings such as tunnel vision.

In my opinion, this is a good thing, because it\u2019s hard (sometimes impossible) to determine for sure that a patient is faking. but with conversion symptoms, we should always keep the possibility in mind and do all we can to rule it out, along with every other confounding diagnosis. Rosalind Noonan Rosalind Noonan came to her university\u2019s student health service because of a stutter. This was remarkable because she was 18 and she had only been stuttering for 2 days. It had begun on Tuesday afternoon during her women\u2019s issues seminar. The class had been discussing sexual harassment, which gradually led to a consideration of sexual molestation. To foster discussion, the graduate student leading the seminar asked each 264 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS participant to comment. When Rosalind\u2019s turn came, she stuttered so badly that she gave up trying to talk at all. \u201cI still ca-ca-ca-can\u2019t understand it,\u201d she told the interviewer. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever had this pr-pr-pro-pro\u2014 difficulty.\u201d Rosalind was a first-year student who had decided to major in psychology, she said, \u201cto help me learn more about myself.\u201d What she already knew included the following. Rosalind had no information about her biological parents. She had been adopted when she was only a week old by a high school physics teacher and his wife, who had no other children. Her father was a rigid and perfectionistic man who dominated both Rosalind and her mother. As a young child, Rosalind was overly active; during her early school years she\u2019d had difficulty focusing her attention. She would probably have qualified for a diagnosis of attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but the only evaluation she had ever had was from their family physician, who thought it was \u201cjust a phase\u201d that she would soon outgrow. Despite that lack of diagnostic rigor, when she was 12 she did begin to grow out of it. By the time she entered high",
    "disorder, but the only evaluation she had ever had was from their family physician, who thought it was \u201cjust a phase\u201d that she would soon outgrow. Despite that lack of diagnostic rigor, when she was 12 she did begin to grow out of it. By the time she entered high school, she was doing nearly straight-A work. Although she had had many friends in high school and had dated extensively, she\u2019d never had a serious boyfriend. Her physical health had been excellent, and her only visits to doctors had been for immunizations. Her mood was almost always bright and cheerful; she had no history of delusions or hallucinations, and she had never used drugs or alcohol. \u201cI g-g-grew up healthy and happy,\u201d she protested. \u201cThat\u2019s why I d-d- d-don\u2019t understand this!\u201d \u201cHardly anyone reaches adulthood without having some problems.\u201d The inter - viewer paused for a response, but received none, and so continued: \u201cFor example, when you were a child, did anyone ever approach you for sex?\u201d Rosalind\u2019s gaze seemed to lose focus as tears trickled from her eyes. Haltingly at first, then in a rush, the following story emerged. When she was 9 or 10, her parents had become friendly with a married couple, both English teachers at her father\u2019s school. When she was 14, the woman had suddenly died; subsequently, the man was invited for dinner on a number of occasions. One evening he consumed too much wine and was put to bed on their living room sofa. Rosalind awakened to find him lying on top of her in her bed, his hand covering her mouth. She was never certain whether he actually entered her, but her struggles apparently caused him to ejaculate. After that, he left her room. He never again returned to their home. The following day she confided her story to her mother, who at first assured Rosa- lind that she must have been dreaming. When confronted with the evidence of the stained sheets, her mother urged her to say nothing about the matter to her father. It was the last time the subject had ever been discussed in their house. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what we thought Daddy would do if he found out,\u201d Rosalind com - mented, with notable fluency, \u201cbut we were both afraid of him.

I felt I\u2019d done some - thing to be punished for, and I suppose Mom must have worried he\u2019d attack the other teacher.\u201d Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) 265 Evaluation of Rosalind Noonan Rosalind\u2019s stuttering is a classic conversion symptom: It suggested or mimicked a medi- cal condition, and its sudden, de novo appearance at college age wasn\u2019t what we\u2019d expect for the stuttering of speech fluency disorder (criteria A, B). Many clinicians would agree that it was precipitated by the stress of discussing long- buried sexual abuse. This aspect of the disorder\u2014the putative psychological factors related to the symptoms\u2014is one criterion for diagnosis that has been eliminated from the DSM-5 revision. How - ever, it is still something to note when you encounter it. The most serious mistake a clinician can make in this context is to diagnose con - version disorder when the symptom is caused by another medical condition (C). Some very peculiar symptoms eventually turn out to have a medical basis. However, the abrupt onset of stuttering in an adult is almost certain to have no identifiable organic cause. The fact that Rosalind\u2019s difficulty disappeared during the discussion would be additional evidence that this was a conversion symptom. Rosalind stated that her health had always been good, but her clinician would nonetheless be well advised to ask about other symptoms that could indicate somatic symptom disorder, in which conversion symptoms are so commonly encountered. The fact that she focused on the symptom, rather than on the fear of having some serious disease, would eliminate illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis) from consider - ation. Although pain is not excluded in the criteria, by convention conversion symptoms don\u2019t usually include pain; when pain occurs as a symptom that is caused or increased by psychological factors, the diagnosis is likely to be somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain. Another condition in which conversion symptoms are sometimes encountered is schizophrenia, but there was no evidence that Rosalind had ever been psychotic. Neither was there evidence that she had consciously feigned her symptom, which would rule out factitious disorder and malingering. Rosalind was concerned about her stuttering (D), which is quite the opposite from the unconcerned indifference (sometimes",

Neither was there evidence that she had consciously feigned her symptom, which would rule out factitious disorder and malingering. Rosalind was concerned about her stuttering (D), which is quite the opposite from the unconcerned indifference (sometimes called la belle indiff\u00e9rence ) often associated with conversion symptoms. Although many of these patients will also have a diagnosis of histrionic, dependent, borderline, or antisocial personality disorder, there was no indication of any of these in Rosalind\u2019s case. As in somatic symptom disorder, mood , anxiety, and dissociative disorders are often associated with conversion disorder. Although Rosalind was terribly stressed by the sexual molestation, her overall functioning was overall pretty good; hence her GAF score would be 75. The type of symptom and presumed psychological stressor are detailed in the final diagnosis: F44.4 [300.11] Conversion disorder, with speech symptom (stuttering), acute episode, with psychological stressor (concerns about molestation) F54 [316] Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions Mental health professionals deal with all sorts of problems that can influence the course or care of a medical condition. The diagnosis of psychological factors affecting other 266 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS medical conditions can be used to identify such patients. Although it is coded as a men- tal disorder and with mental disorders, it does not actually constitute one, so I\u2019ve not provided a full vignette\u2014just a few snippets to illustrate how the diagnosis might be applied. In truth, this condition should have been given a Z-code and stuck in the back with other such conditions, but that wasn\u2019t a possibility: ICD-10 makes the rules. Still, it doesn\u2019t belong up in the front seat, either. Essential Features of Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions A physical symptom or illness is affected by a psychological or behavioral factor that precipitates, worsens, interferes with, or extends the patient\u2019s need for treatment.

It results in severe, life- endangering risk. Code the name of the relevant medical condition first. Some Examples DSM-IV included six specific categories of factors that could change the course of a medical condition. Partly because they were hardly ever used, DSM-5 has ditched these categories. However, I\u2019ve used them as examples that might alert clinicians to the sorts of issue that can affect treatment decisions. If more than one psychological factor is present, choose the one most prominent. Mental disorder. For 15 years Philip\u2019s compliance with treatment for schizophre- nia has been spotty. Now his voices warn him to refuse dialysis. Psychological symptoms (insufficient for a DSM-5 diagnosis). With few other mental symptoms, Alice\u2019s mood has been so low that she hasn\u2019t bothered filling prescriptions for her type II diabetes. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions 267 Personality traits or coping style. Gordon\u2019s lifelong hatred of authority figures has led him to reject his doctor\u2019s recommendation for a stent. Maladaptive health behaviors. Weighing nearly 400 pounds, Tim knows that he should avoid sweetened drinks, but nearly every day his love of Big Gulps wins out. Stress- related physiological response. April\u2019s job as the Governor\u2019s spokesperson is so demanding that she\u2019s had to double up on her antihypertensive drugs. Other or unspecified psychological factors. Harold\u2019s religion prohibits him from accepting a blood transfusion. In Nanja\u2019s culture, a woman mustn\u2019t allow any man not her husband to see her unclothed; her internist is Derek. Of course, you might find a psychological factor or two at play in nearly any medical condi- tion. To use this diagnosis effectively, reserve it for situations in which it is clear that the psychological factor is adversely influencing the course of the illness. F68.10 [300.19] Factitious Disorder Factitious means something artificial. In the context of mental health patients, it means that a disorder looks like bona fide disease, but isn\u2019t. Such patients accomplish this by simulating symptoms (for example, complaining of pain) or physical signs (for instance, warming a thermometer in coffee or submitting a urine specimen that\u2019s been supple - mented with sand).

DSM-5 includes two subtypes of factitious disorder: one in which behaviors affect the person of the perpetrator, and one in which the behaviors affect another individual. Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self People affected by factitious disorder imposed on self (FDIS) can have remarkably dra- matic symptoms, accompanied by outright lying about the severity of the distress. The overall pattern of signs and symptoms may be atypical for the alleged illness, and some patients change their stories upon retelling; either sort of evidence of inconsistency aids identification. Other patients with FDIS, however, know a lot about the symptoms and terminology of disease, which can make their behavior harder to detect. Some will - ingly undergo many procedures (some of them painful or dangerous) to continue in the patient role. With treatment that is ordinarily adequate to address their \u201cdisease,\u201d their symptoms either do not remit or evolve into new complications. Once hospitalized, patients with FDIS often tend to complain bitterly and to argue 268 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS with staff members. They characteristically remain hospitalized for a few days, have few if any visitors, and leave against medical advice once their tests prove negative. Many travel from city to city in the quest for medical care. The most persistent travelers and confabulators among these are sometimes said to have M\u00fcnchausen\u2019s syndrome, named for the fabled baron who told outrageous lies about his adventures. Contrary to its immediate predecessor, DSM-5 doesn\u2019t require speculation as to possible motives for FDIS (or its sibling, FDIA, discussed below)\u2014a blessing for those clinicians who reject the implication that they can read minds. It is enough to detect a pattern of such behavior in a patient whose behavior involves no other person. Patients with FDIS differ profoundly from malingerers, who may show some of the same behaviors\u2014 silting a urine specimen, embellishing the subjective reports of their suffering. However, malingerers do these things to qualify for financial compensation (such as insurance payments), to obtain drugs, or to avoid work, punishment, or, in days gone by, military service.

    "of the same behaviors\u2014 silting a urine specimen, embellishing the subjective reports of their suffering. However, malingerers do these things to qualify for financial compensation (such as insurance payments), to obtain drugs, or to avoid work, punishment, or, in days gone by, military service. The motivation in FDIS is apparently more complex: These patients may need the feeling of being cared for, of duping medical personnel, or simply of receiving a whole lot of attention from important people. For whatever reason, they manufacture physical or psychological symptoms in a way that they may claim they cannot control. The diagnosis of FDIS is made by excluding physical disease and other disorders. (Although it is conceivable that a patient might manufacture a personality disorder, I know of no such cases.) However, many patients with FDIS also have genuine personal- ity disorders. This disorder begins early in life. No one knows how rare it is, though it is probably more common in males than in females. Often it starts with a hospitalization for genu - ine physical problems. It results in severe impairment: These people are often unem - ployed and do not maintain close ties with family or friends. Their lives are complicated (and sometimes put at risk) by tests, medications, and unnecessary surgical procedures. Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another A condition that has been around for only a few years, factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) has just now emerged from an appendix to enter the body of the DSM (there\u2019s a somewhat unsettling image). It used to be called factitious disorder (or M\u00fcnchausen\u2019s) by proxy, because the symptoms are not endured by the patient. Rather, it is the caregiver who both causes factitious symptoms in another person and bears the diagnosis. That \u201cother\u201d is almost always a child, though my Medline search revealed the occasional elderly person and at least one dog. Three- quarters, sometimes more, of the perpetrators are female\u2014 usually the mothers of children exhibiting the symptoms. Because many of these people have a background in health care, it can be hard to catch them out. When apprehended, they often turn out to have a mood or personality disorder, or both; actual psychosis is rare. Some perpetrators have a history of FDIS. Some parents with FDIA appear to believe that the children are ill; they tend to Factitious Disorder 269 behave as \u201cdoctor addicts\u201d who need the attention",
    "they often turn out to have a mood or personality disorder, or both; actual psychosis is rare. Some perpetrators have a history of FDIS. Some parents with FDIA appear to believe that the children are ill; they tend to Factitious Disorder 269 behave as \u201cdoctor addicts\u201d who need the attention that comes with having a desper - ately ill child. These people usually limit themselves to the false reporting of signs and symptoms of disease, such as seizures or apnea. Others, however, will actually induce symptoms\u2014most commonly by suffocation or poisoning, but also by falsifying urine or stool samples or other lab specimens. Perhaps half the victims have a real physical illness, in addition. Overall, FDIA is rare, with an annual incidence of just 0.4\u20132 per 100,000 popu - lation. This translates to perhaps 600 new cases in the United States each year. Most are not single parents; often they are described as exemplary parents, though they may react inappropriately (for example, excitement) upon receiving bad news. Three- quarters of instances of FDIA occur in hospitals. Victims are about equally male and female. Though most are under age 5, some are older. As you might expect, when a teen is involved, there is often a degree of collu- sion with the perpetrator. The death rate overall is an appalling 10%, most often when poisoning or suffocation is involved. Medical personnel may be persuaded to prescribe for the child treatment that is unneeded and perhaps harmful. Indeed, the doctor may be the one most taken in; an occasional physician even becomes angry at staff members who accumulate evidence of the caregiver\u2019s perfidy. Indeed, some experts recommend against informing the doc- tor when covert surveillance is planned, to lessen the risk that the perpetrator will be tipped off. The suspicions of medical personnel may be alerted by a parent who seems insuf- ficiently concerned about a sick child, by symptoms that seem to make no sense, or by a child whose symptoms continue despite treatment that should be adequate. In some cases, however, the parent perpetrator appears so distraught that the physician remains steadfastly unaware of the potential for foul play. Then the injuries will continue until the perpetrator is apprehended, the child dies, or with the march of time, the perpetra- tor moves on to involve a younger child.

Then the injuries will continue until the perpetrator is apprehended, the child dies, or with the march of time, the perpetra- tor moves on to involve a younger child. In one survey, over 70% of victims sustained disfigurement or permanent disability. Patients with factitious disorder sometimes take on symptoms of new (and often poorly investigated) illnesses\u2014the \u201cdisorder du jour\u201d phenomenon. The criteria for the diagnoses are not very specific, and the patients are difficult to manage and often disagreeable. It is far too easy to dismiss them with a diagnosis of factitious disorder without first taking steps to ensure that we have first ruled out every other possible causative mental (and physical) condition. I\u2019d also point out that here in the differential diagnosis, I\u2019ve used the term malinger - ing\u2014a rare occurrence in this book. Why is that? Surely people malinger other symptoms and disorders. Of course they can, and sometimes do. b ut I feel strongly that it is incum- bent on clinicians to be extremely chary of malingering as a diagnostic formulation. 270 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS Essential Features of Factitious Disorder To present a picture of someone who is ill, injured, or impaired, {the patient}{another person, acting for the patient} feigns physical or mental symptoms or signs of illness, or induces a disease or injury. This behavior occurs even without evident benefits (such as financial gain, revenge, or avoiding legal responsibility).

    "he came to the emergency room of a Midwestern hospital late one Saturday night, complaining of crushing substernal chest pain. Although his elec - trocardiogram (EKG) was markedly abnormal, it did not show the changes typical of an acute myocardial infarction. The cardiologist on call, noting his ashen pallor and obvious distress, ordered him admitted to the cardiac ICU, then waited for the cardiac enzyme results. The following day, Jason\u2019s EKG was unchanged, and the serum enzymes showed no evidence of heart muscle damage. His chest pain continued. He complained loudly that he was being ignored. The cardiologist urgently requested a mental health consul- tation. At age 47, Jason was a slightly built man with a bright, shifting gaze and a 4-day growth of beard. He spoke with a nasal Boston accent. His right shoulder bore the tattoo of a boot and the legend \u201cBorn To Kick Ass.\u201d Throughout the interview he fre - Factitious Disorder 271 quently complained of chest pain, but he breathed and talked normally, and he showed no evident anxiety about his medical condition. He said he had grown up in Quincy, Massachusetts, the son of a physician. After high school he had attended college for several years, but found he was \u201ctoo creative\u201d to stick with a profession or a conventional job. Instead, he had turned to inventing medi- cal devices, and numbered among his successes a positive- pressure respirator that bore his name. Although he had made several fortunes, he had lost nearly everything to his penchant for playing the stock market. He had been visiting in the area, relaxing, when the chest pain struck. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve never had it before?\u201d asked the interviewer, looking through the chart. Jason denied that he\u2019d had any previous heart trouble. \u201cNot even a twinge. I\u2019ve always been blessed with good health.\u201d \u201cEver been hospitalized?\u201d \u201cNope. Well, not since a tonsillectomy when I was a kid.\u201d Further questioning was similarly unproductive. As the interviewer left, Jason was demanding extra meal service. Playing a hunch, the interviewer began telephoning emergency room physicians in the Boston area to ask about a patient with Jason\u2019s name or peculiar tattoo. The third try struck pay dirt. \u201cJason Bird? I wondered when we\u2019d hear from him again. He\u2019s been in and out of half the facilities in the state.

He\u2019s been in and out of half the facilities in the state. His funny- looking EKG\u2014probably an old MI\u2014looks pretty bad, so he always gets admitted, but there\u2019s never any evidence that anything acute is going on. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s addicted. A couple of years ago, he was admitted for a genuine pneumonia and got through a week without pain medication and with no withdrawal symptoms. He\u2019ll stay in the ICU a couple of days and rag on the staff. Then he\u2019ll split. He seems to enjoy needling medical people.\u201d \u201cHe told me that he was the son of a physician and that he was a wealthy inventor.\u201d The voice on the other end of the line chuckled. \u201cThe old respirator story. I checked into that one when he was admitted here for the third time. That was a different Bird altogether. I don\u2019t know that Jason\u2019s ever invented anything in his life\u2014other than his medical history. As for his father, I think he was a chiropractor.\u201d Returning to the ward to add a note to the chart, the interviewer discovered that Jason had discharged himself against advice and departed, leaving behind a letter of complaint to the hospital administrator. Evaluation of Jason Bird Jason illustrates the principal difficulty of diagnosing factitious disorder: The criteria depend heavily on the clinician\u2019s ability to determine that the signs and symptoms presented are intentionally falsified (criterion A). Sometimes that\u2019s easy, as when you find the patient scratching open a wound or parking the thermometer on a radiator. But often the intent to deceive must be inferred, as in Jason\u2019s case, from a string of visits to diverse health care facilities for the same complaint. Jason\u2019s EKG did not change and 272 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS his cardiac enzymes were not elevated, so his interviewer inferred that Jason was feign- ing or markedly exaggerating his chest pain. That assumption may have been correct, but it was supported not by proof, only by reports from the emergency room. Jason presented himself as ill (B), even in the absence of external motivation such as monetary gain or escape from punishment (C).

    "not by proof, only by reports from the emergency room. Jason presented himself as ill (B), even in the absence of external motivation such as monetary gain or escape from punishment (C). That was important, for such behavior is the principal ingredient that differentiates factitious disorder from malingering \u2014 which of course we must consider, if only to refute it. Malingering carries with it no cri- teria, but we commonly agree that it occurs when a person consciously pretends to have a disorder in order to gain something of value: money (from insurance, a lawsuit, com- pensation); drugs (from a sympathetic physician); avoidance of a conviction for a crime; or release from, for example, military service. For Jason, no such gain was apparent. The list of other differential diagnoses is predictable. Most important, of course, FDIS must be differentiated from physical illnesses. This was soon accomplished in Jason\u2019s case. Then other mental disorders must be ruled out. Patients with somatic symptom disorder may also complain of symptoms that have no apparent organic basis. Those with antisocial personality disorder may lie about symptoms, but they usually have some material gain in mind (to avoid punishment, to obtain money). Some patients with schizophrenia have a bizarre lifestyle that could be confused with the wanderings of classic M\u00fcnchausen\u2019s syndrome, but their content of thought will usually include clear delusions and hallucinations. Patients who feign psychological symptoms may look as though they have dementia or brief psychotic disorder. None of these disorders could be supported by Jason\u2019s history or cross- sectional presentation. Several other disorders may accompany FDIS. These include substance- related disorders (involving sedatives and analgesics) and dependent, histrionic, and border- line personality disorders. Many patients with FDIS have a serious personality disor- der, but of course we have far too little information for such a diagnosis in Jason\u2019s case. We\u2019d need to mention the possibility in the summary we dictate. With a GAF score of 41, here is how I\u2019d diagnose Jason Bird: F68.10 [300.19] Factitious disorder imposed on self Claudia Frankel Police reports are usually pretty dry; they don\u2019t often moisten the eye.

    "the eye. The Frankel case proved the exception to that rule. When Rose Frankel was only 2 years old, she began to experience intestinal and other symptoms that would fill the next 6 years of her life. It started with spells of vom- iting that seemed intractable to treatment. In all, she was carried back and forth to the pediatrician\u2019s office, and frequently to the hospital, some 200 times. Each visit led to new tests, new attempts at treatment that led nowhere. She had undergone nearly two dozen operative procedures, and swallowed numerous medications for diarrhea, infec- tions, seizures, and spells of vomiting, when finally nurses on the pediatric intensive care unit noticed that Rose would appear to be on the mend until her mother, Claudia, Factitious Disorder 273 arrived and would take her to a private room. They\u2019d hear Rose crying, and her health would take another turn for the worse\u2014 sometimes, just when she was thought ready for discharge. In all, Rose suffered nearly a dozen serious infections; one of them, a life- threatening sepsis, involved multiple organisms. Through it all, Claudia worked closely with their family doctor. They would speak in person or on the phone several times a day, and Dr. Bhend often spoke of Claudia as his \u201cgood right arm\u201d in trying to get to the bottom of the calamity that was engulfing their patient. During the 4 years of her medical ordeal, the only time that Rose remained healthy longer than a month was when Claudia left town to nurse her own mother, during what proved to be that old lady\u2019s final illness. For the last few weeks of her kindergarten year, Rose bloomed. But she sickened again, shortly after Grandma died and Claudia returned home. Several on the hospital nursing staff were beyond suspicious. Once, they\u2019d found a bottle of Ipecac discarded in the room Rose had occupied. On another occasion, a mon- itoring device that three staff members had checked within the hour had been found turned off. As they told the investigating officers, most staff members had concluded that Claudia was directly responsible for her daughter\u2019s illness, so they hid a camera in the private room Claudia always used during Rose\u2019s many admissions. When he found out, Dr. Bhend, concerned about the loss of trust, warned Claudia of the \u201cimpend - ing sting.\u201d That afternoon, she checked Rose out of the",

When he found out, Dr. Bhend, concerned about the loss of trust, warned Claudia of the \u201cimpend - ing sting.\u201d That afternoon, she checked Rose out of the hospital, and they were lost to follow-up. The staff revealed the full details to the police, who opened a file but were never able to pull together solid information. FDIa is just one of the new DSM-5 disorders that was included in an appendix of DSM-IV as a possible diagnosis that needed further study. a lso making the big time after years of study are premenstrual dysphoric disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, binge- eating disorder, and (my personal favorite) caffeine withdrawal. Welcome aboard, all! Evaluation of Claudia Frankel Two of the criteria required for a diagnosis of factitious disorder were easily satisfied. There was nothing to suggest an external reward for Claudia\u2019s behavior such as finan - cial gain (criterion C), and she certainly did present Rose as being impaired (D). Two others we have to take on faith: although the circumstantial evidence was strong that Rose\u2019s symptoms were fabricated, the staff just missed nailing down the proof (A). And, we cannot be sure that Claudia had no other mental disorder such as a delusional disor- der that could better explain her behavior (D). Therefore, our current diagnosis should be treated as provisional. I would make a note in her chart to the effect that further investigation would be needed in regard to a personality disorder; in ICD-10, we can no longer code \u201cdiagnosis deferred\u201d in that category. 274 SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND rELATED DISO rDErS Assigning Claudia\u2019s GAF score prompts some discussion. Should we base our judg- ment on the fact that she was able to function well in most areas of her life, or on the effect of her behavior on Jennifer and on their relationship? In my opinion, the disas - trous consequences of her impaired judgment would be the deciding factor here; hence the very low GAF score of 30. However, others might see her situation quite differently and choose to argue. Note that Rose herself would be given the code Z69.010 [V61.21] to reflect the fact that she had suffered from physical abuse by a parent.

Keep in mind that with more information, such a patient may qualify for a diagnosis in a different chapter or for another diagnosis in this one. Pseudocyesis.

Quick Guide to the Feeding and Eating Disorders As usual, the page number following each item indicates where a more detailed discussion begins. Primary Feeding and Eating Disorders Each of the primary feeding and eating disorders involves abnormal behaviors concerning the act of consumption. Anorexia nervosa is less common than is bulimia nervosa, and both are less common than the newbie, binge- eating disorder. The overall prevalence of these three disorders may be increasing. The three remaining specific disorders were transplanted from the old childhood/adolescence section of DSM-IV. Anorexia nervosa.

Despite the fact that they are severely underweight, these patients see themselves as fat (p. 277). Bulimia nervosa. These patients eat in binges, then prevent weight gain by self- induced vomiting, purging, and exercise. Although appearance is important to their self- evaluations, they do not have the body image distortion characteristic of anorexia nervosa (p. 281). Binge- eating disorder. These patients eat in binges, but do not try to compensate by vomit- ing, exercising, or using laxatives (p. 284). Pica. The patient eats material that is not food (p. 288). Rumination disorder. The person persistently regurgitates and re-chews food already eaten (p. 289). Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder . An individual\u2019s failure to eat enough leads to weight loss or a failure to gain weight (p. 291). Other specified, or unspecified, feeding or eating disorder. Use one of these categories for a disorder of feeding or eating that does not meet the criteria for any of those mentioned above (p. 292). Other Causes of Abnormal Appetite and Weight Mood disorders. Patients with a major depressive episode (or dysthymia) can experience either anorexia with weight loss or increased appetite with weight gain (pp. 122 and 138). Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Bizarre eating habits are occasionally encoun- tered in psychotic patients (p. 64). Somatic symptom disorder. Complaints of marked weight fluctuation and appetite distur - bance may be encountered in these patients (p. 251). Simple obesity. This is not a DSM-5 diagnosis (there\u2019s no evidence that it is associated with any defined mental or emotional pathology). But emotional problems that contribute to the development or maintenance of obesity can be coded as psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (p. 266). There is now also a separate medical code for overweight or obesity. Introduction Eating too little and eating too much have probably caused trouble as long as there have been eaters. Nearly everyone has pursued one of these behaviors at one time or another. But like so many behaviors, when carried to extremes, they can be dangerous; sometimes they turn deadly. Although the criteria crisply distinguish one from another, patients can move back and forth between the disorders and subclinical presentations. Anorexia Nervosa Recognized for nearly 200 years, anorexia nervosa (AN) has three main components. The patient (1) restricts food intake",
    "to extremes, they can be dangerous; sometimes they turn deadly. Although the criteria crisply distinguish one from another, patients can move back and forth between the disorders and subclinical presentations. Anorexia Nervosa Recognized for nearly 200 years, anorexia nervosa (AN) has three main components. The patient (1) restricts food intake to the point of markedly reduced body weight, yet (2) remains inordinately concerned about obesity or weight gain, and (3) has the distorted self- perception of being overweight. Other symptoms are elaborations of maladaptive eating behaviors\u2014food restriction, excessive exercise, and vomiting or other methods of purging. Although many female patients stop menstruating, the absence of menses doesn\u2019t provide a meaningful distinction, so it\u2019s been dropped as a criterion. Patients Anorexia Nervosa 277 with AN may have abnormal vital signs (slow heart rate, low blood pressure); abnormal lab values and other tests can also occur (anemia, loss of bone density, EKG changes). AN carries with it serious health consequences. Although two- thirds of commu - nity sample patients have remitted at 5 years, mortality (due to substance use, suicide, and malnutrition) is about six times that of the general population. Clinical popula - tions may (no surprise) fare worse. Those who binge and then purge to maintain low weight tend to be older, to be sicker, and to have worse outcomes than those who only restrict their intake, yielding the two clinical subtypes. Crossover between subtypes often occurs, however (more often from the restrictor type than to it), limiting predic- tive validity. Depression and anxiety are frequently concomitants. AN affects a bit under 1% of the female population; the rate for males is perhaps a third of that. It is more common among adolescent and young adults, especially those who are figure skaters or gymnasts (women) or jockeys or long- distance runners (men). The restricting type is the more usual. The concordance rate is higher in identical than in fraternal twins, indicating a degree of genetic underpinning. More patients with AN are seen by family practitioners than by mental health specialists. Essential Features of Anorexia Nervosa These patients are usually young women who (1) eat so little that many look skel - etal, yet (2) remain fearful of obesity or weight gain and (3) have the distorted self- perception that they are fat. The Fine Print Some patients may not admit to fear of overweight, but take steps anyway to avert",

The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (note that the diagnostic criteria don\u2019t actually specify dura - tion; however, we are required to specify the subtype that applies to the previous 3 months, which suggests a minimum duration) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders, mood or anxiety disorders, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, bulimia nervosa) Coding Notes Specify type that applies to the previous 3 months: F50.02 [307.1] Binge- eating/purging type. The patient has repeatedly purged (vomited; misused enemas, laxatives, or diuretics) or eaten in binges. F50.01 [307.1] Restricting type. The patient has not recently binged or purged. 278 FEEDING AND EATING DISO rDErS Based on body mass index (BMI; kg/meter2), specify severity (level may be increased, depending on functional impairment). For adults, levels are as follows: Mild. BMI of 17 or more. Moderate. BMI of 16\u201317. Severe. BMI of 15\u201316. Extreme. BMI under 15. Specify if: In partial remission. For what DSM-5 calls \u201ca sustained period\u201d (p. 339), the patient is no longer significantly underweight, but still is overly concerned about weight or still has misconceptions about body weight/shape. In full remission. For \u201ca sustained period,\u201d the patient has met no criteria for AN. Marlene Richmond A statuesque blonde (5 feet 7 inches tall), Marlene Richmond weighed just over 80 pounds on the day she was admitted to the hospital. Dressed in a jogging suit and leg warmers, she spent part of the initial interview doing deep knee bends. Information for her history was also provided by her older sister, who accompanied her to the hospital. Marlene grew up in a small town in southern Illinois. Her father, who drilled wells for a living, had a drinking problem. Her mother, severely overweight, started numerous fad diets but never had much success with any of them. One of Marlene\u2019s earliest memories was her own resolve that she would not grow up to be like either of her parents.

The concerns of her 10th-grade social circle revolved around appearance, clothing, and diet. That year alone, Marlene dropped 15 pounds from her highest weight ever, which was 125 pounds; even then she complained to her friends that she was too fat. Throughout her high school career, she remained fascinated by food. She took both introductory and advanced home economics. She spent much of her time in computer science class devising a database that would count the calories in any recipe. Whenever she was allowed to do so, Marlene ate in her room while watching tele- vision. If forced to eat with the family, she spent much of the meal rearranging the food on her plate or mashing it with a fork and taking the smallest bites that wouldn\u2019t fall through the tines. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she said during her admission interview. \u201cI think about food most of the time. But I look so bloated and disgusting\u2014I can\u2019t stand to see myself in the mirror. If I eat even a little bit too much, I feel so stuffed and guilty that I have to bring it back up.\u201d Two years earlier, Marlene had started vomiting whenever she thought she had overeaten. At first she would stick her finger or the end of a pencil down her throat; Anorexia Nervosa 279 once she tried some Ipecac she found in the medicine cabinet at a friend\u2019s house. She soon learned simply to vomit at will, without any chemical or mechanical aids. She also reduced her weight with diuretics and laxatives. The diuretics helped her shave off a pound or two, but they left her so thirsty that she would soon gain it back. Once or twice a week, she would binge on high- carbohydrate food (she preferred corn chips and cola), then vomit up what she had eaten. Other than her remarkable thinness and pallor, which was subsequently attrib - uted to anemia, Marlene\u2019s appearance at admission was normal. She stopped exercising when the clinician requested it, but she asked whether the hospital had a stair-step exerciser she could use later. Her mood was cheerful and her flow of thought logical. She had no delusions or hallucinations, though she admitted that she was terrified of gaining weight. However, she",
    "She stopped exercising when the clinician requested it, but she asked whether the hospital had a stair-step exerciser she could use later. Her mood was cheerful and her flow of thought logical. She had no delusions or hallucinations, though she admitted that she was terrified of gaining weight. However, she denied having any other phobias, obsessions, or compul- sions; she had never had a panic attack. Most of her spontaneous comments concerned menu planning and cooking; she volunteered that she might like to become a dietitian. She appeared bright and attentive, and made a perfect score on the MMSE. Marlene\u2019s only health concern was that she hadn\u2019t had a menstrual period for 5 or 6 months. She knew she wasn\u2019t pregnant because she hadn\u2019t even had a date for a year. \u201cI think I\u2019d be more attractive if I could just lose another couple of pounds,\u201d she said. Evaluation of Marlene Richmond Despite the fact that she was markedly underweight for her height (criterion A), Mar - lene continued to express inappropriate concerns about gaining weight (B). Her disgust at her own image in the mirror suggests the distorted view patients with AN have of themselves (C). Her loss of weight was profound enough that she had not had a men - strual period for several months. Although not all patients take active steps to avoid weight gain (some only restrict intake), Marlene\u2019s vomiting and use of diuretics and laxatives are classic for AN. Loss of appetite and weight are commonly found in a variety of medical illnesses (liver disease, severe infections, and cancer, to name but a few); these must be ruled out by appropriate medical history and tests. Because the symptoms of AN are so distinc - tive, it is rarely confused with other mental disorders. Loss of weight and anorexia can be encountered in somatic symptom disorder, but for that diagnosis, a patient must show excessive concern about the symptoms\u2014 and Marlene\u2019s attitude seemed the antithesis of concern. Patients with schizophre- nia will sometimes have peculiar eating habits, but unless they become dangerously underweight and have the typical distortion of self-image, both diagnoses should not be made. Hunger strikes are usually brief and occur in the context of trying to influence the behavior of others for personal or political benefit. Patients with bulimia nervosa usually maintain body weight at an acceptable level. Despite the fact that Marlene",

Hunger strikes are usually brief and occur in the context of trying to influence the behavior of others for personal or political benefit. Patients with bulimia nervosa usually maintain body weight at an acceptable level. Despite the fact that Marlene binged and purged, neither bulimia nervosa nor binge- eating disorder should be diag- nosed when bingeing and purging occur only during AN. However, some patients who initially have AN later become bulimic. Bulimia nervosa may also be diagnosed if there 280 FEEDING AND EATING DISO rDErS is a history of binge\u2013purge cycles that occur during times the patient does not meet criteria for AN. Several mental disorders are often associated with AN. Major depressive disorder could be diagnosed if Marlene had had symptoms of mood disorder. Panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, and substance use may also complicate diagnosis and treatment. Patients with AN may also fear eating in public, though you wouldn\u2019t give an additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder if the anxiety symptoms are strictly limited to eating behaviors. Specific personality disorders have not been identified, but patients with AN are reported to be somewhat rigid and perfectionistic. Marlene\u2019s history of binge\u2013purge cycles would fit the specifier of binge- eating/ purging type, which we\u2019ll add in coding. Her GAF score would be 45; her full diagnosis would be as follows: E44.0 [263.0] Malnutrition, moderate F50.02 [307.1] Anorexia nervosa, binge- eating/purging type F50.2 [307.51] Bulimia Nervosa Let\u2019s start by sketching an idealized mealtime. Wouldn\u2019t it involve the pleasant antici- pation of sharing good food with friends, savoring every bite while lingering at the table for fellowship and conversation? That\u2019s just not the way for people with bulimia nervosa (BN), whose dining experiences tend toward the polar opposite. Typically, in response to feelings of depression or stress, they gobble their food, consuming quantities far in excess of a normal meal. Because they\u2019re ashamed of their way-out-of- control behavior, they eat alone. And then they head to the bathroom and throw it all up. Their own self- evaluation involves body shape and how they look; in that, they resemble patients with anorexia nervosa. What they don\u2019t have is the distorted view of being fat when they are not. Starting in their late teens or early 20s, patients with BN will wolf down prodi - gious quantities of food once a week",
    "and how they look; in that, they resemble patients with anorexia nervosa. What they don\u2019t have is the distorted view of being fat when they are not. Starting in their late teens or early 20s, patients with BN will wolf down prodi - gious quantities of food once a week or more, often past the point of uncomfortable sati- ety. (These binges can be discontinuous; for example, occasionally one is interrupted by travel between dining venues.) The fact that these patients are generally about normal in weight (some are overweight, but not obese) would be surprising, were it not for their compensatory behavior. Besides vomiting, which some do so often that the enamel wears off their lower teeth, they may use laxatives or other drugs; others exercise exces- sively, just as in anorexia nervosa. Still others fast between binges. But nearly all vomit. BN is more common than anorexia nervosa, affecting 1\u20132% of adult women (men much less so). (The crossover rate with anorexia nervosa is in the 10% neighborhood.) It is more frequently found in people whose professions and activities emphasize slim body lines\u2014 gymnastics, figure skating, dance, modeling. For unknown reasons, the incidence has probably decreased somewhat over the past 20 years. Like patients with other eating disorders, patients with BN often have comorbid conditions (especially mood and anxiety disorders, but also problems with impulse control and substance use). Bulimia Nervosa 281 With time, nearly half of patients with BN recover fully, and another quarter improve. But that final quarter settle into chronic bulimic behavior. Although mortality rates are higher than average for any comparison age group, the condition is less lethal than AN. The suicide rate, however, is higher than in the general population. Table 9.1 compares BN with anorexia nervosa and with binge- eating disorder, discussed next. Essential Features of Bulimia Nervosa A patient has lost control over eating, consuming in binges much more food than is normal for a similar time frame. Fasting, vomiting, extreme physical workouts, and the abuse of laxatives or other drugs may be used to control weight.

I\u2019m totally out of control.\u201d As she told her story, Bernadine Hawley frequently dabbed at her eyes with a wad of tis - sues. She was single and 32, and she taught second grade. She had never before sought mental health care. During her first 2 years in college, Bernadine had been moderately anorectic. Con- vinced that she was too fat, she starved and purged herself down to a scant 98 pounds, strung out along her 5-foot-5-inch frame. In those years she was always hungry and would often go on food binges, during which she would \u201cclean out the refrigerator\u2014 282 FEEDING AND EATING DISO rDErS mine or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d She later admitted, \u201cI must have looked pretty sparse.\u201d By the time she finished college, her weight had returned to a steady 120 pounds, controlled by self- induced vomiting. During the intervening 10 years, Bernadine had followed a binge-and-purge pat - tern. On the average, twice a week she would come home from work, assemble a meal for three, and consume it. She preferred sweets and starches\u2014at a sitting she might consume two lasagna TV dinners, a quart of frozen yogurt, and a dozen sugar donuts, none of which required much effort to prepare. Between courses she vomited up nearly all she took in. If she didn\u2019t feel like \u201ccooking,\u201d she went out for fast food, wolfing down as many as four Big Macs in half an hour. What she relished seemed to be not the taste but the act of consumption; one evening she ate a stick of butter dipped in confection- er\u2019s sugar. In a fit of remorse, she once calculated that during a single evening\u2019s binge, she had consumed and regurgitated over 10,000 calories. She also",

In a fit of remorse, she once calculated that during a single evening\u2019s binge, she had consumed and regurgitated over 10,000 calories. She also frequently purged herself with laxatives. The laxatives were effective, but expensive enough that Bernadine felt constrained to steal them. To minimize the chances of detection, she was careful to shoplift only one package at a time. She man - aged always to keep at least a 3-month supply on the shelf at the back of her closet. Bernadine was the only child of a Midwestern couple she described as \u201csolidly dysfunctional.\u201d Because her parents never celebrated the date of their anniversary, she assumed that her own conception had precipitated the marriage. Her mother worked in a bank and was cold and controlling; her father, a barber, drank. In the resulting marital strife, Bernadine was alternately censured and ignored. She\u2019d had friends as a child and as an adult, though some of her girlfriends complained that she was overly con - cerned with her weight and figure. From the few times she\u2019d tried it in college, she\u2019d discovered that she had a healthy appetite for sex. But feelings of shame and embar - rassment about her bulimia had kept her from forming any long- lasting relationships. She was often lonely and sad, though these feelings never lasted longer than a few days. Although Bernadine admitted that her weight was currently normal, she was very concerned about it. She clipped low-fat recipes and belonged to a health club. She had often told herself she would give everything she owned to get rid of her bingeing. TABLE 9.1.

Evaluation of Bernadine Hawley As is true for many patients with BN, Bernadine\u2019s disorder began with behavior typical of moderate anorexia nervosa. She currently would not qualify for that diagnosis, how- ever (her weight was normal, and she did not have a distorted self-image\u2014 criterion E). During her later binge\u2013purge episodes, she lost control and ate far more than normal (A1 and A2). She also maintained weight by vomiting and using laxatives (B). Friends had pointed out that she focused excessively on her figure and weight (D). Her episodes occurred more often than weekly and had lasted far longer than the 3-month minimum (C). Shoplifting isn\u2019t a criterion for BN, but the two often occur together. Though any history of stealing should raise the possibility of antisocial or borderline personality disorder, no evidence for either is given in the vignette. When criteria for kleptomania are met, it should also be diagnosed. Rarely, neurological disorders (some epilepsies, Kleine\u2013Levin syndrome) can present with overeating. Excessive appetite can also occur in major depressive dis - order with atypical features. Bernadine showed no evidence of either of these condi - tions. She did not misuse alcohol or drugs, though many patients with BN do. Bernadine engaged in overeating and purging a couple of times per week; this would rate her a severity level of mild. However, the vignette gives no indication of her overall functionality, so we have to base her GAF score of 61 strictly on her eating behaviors. Her clinician should dig deeply to inquire whether her eating behavior had had an impact on personal relationships and her work experience. If so, and if it was severe, we\u2019d want to increase the severity level of both her BN (it\u2019s permitted under DSM-5 guidelines) and her GAF score (encouraged under my guidelines). Right now, her diagnosis would read: F50.2 [307.51] Bulimia nervosa, mild F50.8 [307.51] Binge- Eating Disorder When it comes to food, who among us has never overindulged?

    "it comes to food, who among us has never overindulged? (In good conscience, perhaps no one should cast the first scone.) An extra wedge of pie at Thanksgiving, a triple-dip cone after lunch, and we are left, replete and groaning, vowing to sin no more. Heap on extra portions by the plateful, garnish with shame, warm and serve ad lib, and you have the recipe for binge- eating disorder (BED). Overeating behavior usually starts during the teens or early 20s, sometimes on the heels of a diet. The two central features are the rate of consumption (total amounts can be prodigious) and the sense of loss of control over eating behavior. Patients don\u2019t have 284 FEEDING AND EATING DISO rDErS specific cravings, and their selections can be both varied and varying with time. Unlike patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa, patients with BED don\u2019t usually go back and forth from other eating disorders. Though BED is a newcomer among officially recognized diagnoses (DSM-IV said it required more study), it is the most common of the eating disorders, affecting about 2% of adults and perhaps half that many adolescents. It occurs nearly twice as often in women as in men, and for some reason is especially prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes. Although it is often associated with obesity, only about one- quarter of over- weight patients have BED. However, obese people are far more likely than the general population to experience episodes of binge eating; those who do have BED may find it especially hard to lose weight. This partly heritable condition often begins as a diet winds down. The eating binges typically occur when the person is feeling glum or anxious, and they often involve delicious foods high in fat, sugar, salt, and guilt. Rapid eating forestalls sati - ety until too much has been consumed, leading to an uncomfortable, overfull feeling. Bingeing may occur secretly as a consequence of shame and embarrassment, which contribute even more to distress and problems with quality of life than does the simple fact of obesity. Essential Features of Binge- Eating Disorder A patient has lost control, consuming in binges much more food than is normal in a similar time frame. During a binge the patient will eat too fast, too much (until pain- fully full), yet in the absence of actual hunger. The bingeing causes guilt (sometimes, depression) and solitary dining",
    "A patient has lost control, consuming in binges much more food than is normal in a similar time frame. During a binge the patient will eat too fast, too much (until pain- fully full), yet in the absence of actual hunger. The bingeing causes guilt (sometimes, depression) and solitary dining (to avoid embarrassment), but it does not result in behaviors (such as vomiting and excessive exercise) designed to make up for overeat- ing.

Now, at 5 feet 3 inches, she weighed 210 pounds. \u201cI\u2019m 37 now; for years, my BMI has been tracking with my age.\u201d Monica\u2019s bingeing started years ago, on the heels of a busted relationship. Now, at least twice a week, she would cook supper\u2014she especially loved pasta with hazelnuts. She\u2019d devour one helping, then gobble down another, then another. Even if she wasn\u2019t still hungry, she\u2019d then have ice cream (\u201cAt least two servings\u2014I just scarf it down, no thinking involved\u201d) and cookies. Though she felt stuffed (\u201cwith nosh and remorse\u201d), she never vomited up what she had eaten; she\u2019d never used laxatives or other drugs to purge. Washing the dishes afterwards, she was often surprised to realize that only 30 minutes had elapsed. \u201cI\u2019ve always been large.

Born and reared on the West Coast, Monica had been married and divorced; she now lived with her 15-year-old son, Roland, whose weight was normal. She tended to binge on weekends, when she wasn\u2019t working. It had worsened since Roland developed his own set of friends and was \u201coff doing his own thing.\u201d Monica\u2019s self-image was mixed: \u201cI have a terrific sense of humor and a really pretty face, but I know I\u2019m huge. My ex- husband loved hiking in the mountains, but in the end, he decided he didn\u2019t want to be married to one.\u201d Monica worked as a radio announcer for her local public broadcasting affiliate. Her \u201cfinal straw\u201d moment occurred when she was almost offered a better job. \u201cA producer for cable TV heard me on the radio and liked my voice. But when we met for coffee, he lost interest.\u201d She looked sad, but then, with just a hint of a smile, she added, \u201cCan\u2019t you just see me on TV? It\u2019d have to be wide- screen.\u201d Evaluation of Monica Hudgens In a meal, Monica ate far more than most people would in similar circumstances, and she clearly voiced her loss of control (\u201cI\u2019ve given up . . . no thinking involved\u201d (crite - ria A1, A2). These binge episodes occurred at least once a week and had lasted many 286 FEEDING AND EATING DISO rDErS months (D). During an episode, she ate rapidly (\u201cgobbled down\u201d her food), felt uncom- fortably full, and ate when she wasn\u2019t physically hungry (B1, B2, B3). She also expressed contempt for her own eating behavior and ate alone (B4, B5); this might be due to embarrassment, though the vignette doesn\u2019t make that point clear. Only three of the criterion B symptoms are required for diagnosis. Her distress (C) was apparent from her first statement to the clinician. Monica would not qualify for an alternative eating disorder diagnosis: the absence of purging and other behavior to compensate for her overeating (E) would rule out bulimia nervosa , and her weight would obviously put paid to anorexia nervosa. However, she fully earned the diagnosis of BED. Some medical illnesses that involve heavy eating have already been mentioned in connection with bulimia nervosa.

Some medical illnesses that involve heavy eating have already been mentioned in connection with bulimia nervosa. In addition to those, Monica showed no evidence of Prader\u2013Willi syndrome (caused by deletion of several genes from chromosome 15), in which the patient is often markedly overweight and eats voraciously. However, that condition is usually apparent from childhood and is associated with low intelligence. Monica also denied ever using marijuana; cannabis intoxication is sometimes attended by increased appetite. Most patients with BED also have a history of other DSM-5 diagnoses, especially mood and anxiety disorders and problems with substance use; for many, a substance use disorder is concurrent. Any second diagnosis predicts that the patient will have more severe BED symptoms. Monica should be fully evaluated for major depressive disorder with atypical features, which can involve overeating and weight gain. Monica only binged a couple of times a week, which the severity criteria say should rate her at mild. However, I thought I detected a note of desperation in what she told the clinician. Despite a relatively healthy GAF score of 61, I\u2019m going to assign her a severity level of moderate. Does anyone want to argue? F50.8 [307.51] Binge- eating disorder, moderate E66.9 [278.00] Obesity Whereas a bright line separates most physical disorders from normal, an astonishing num- ber of mental disorders are basically just everyday behavior writ large. Disordered eating, substance use, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and even personality disorders are made up of bits of behavior that perfectly normal people experience at one time or another. DSM-5 uses several features to discriminate diagnosable pathology from the everyday. Number of symptoms. If you occasionally feel a bit anxious, welcome to life in the 21st century! If you have episodes that include marked anxiety, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, sweating, and weakness, you may have panic disorder. Level of distress.

For example, consider dysthymia (duration) and cyclothymic disorder (duration plus frequency). Severe sequels. These include suicide or suicide attempts, profound loss of weight, and violent acting out. Exclusions. Most disorders require that we rule out medical illnesses and substance use; for bED, we exclude patients who have anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. For most, there are other mental disorders to consider in our differential. Some criteria sets get by with one of these mechanisms; others use a belt and sus - penders approach. a few utilize most or all of these categories, in effect adding thumbs through the belt loops for added security. The remaining conditions in this chapter are noted primarily in children. Two (pica and rumination disorder) occur during normal early childhood development. We really don\u2019t know how often they occur in adults, but they seem to have relatively little presence in most mental health populations. Ergo, no vignettes. Pica Pica, or the consumption of non- nutritional substances, has been commonly reported in young children and pregnant women. The list of consumables is lengthy, and the vari- ety at times astonishing\u2014dirt, chalk, plaster, soap, paper, and even (rarely) feces. One patient from India had consumed quantities of iron nails and glass beads. Pica has been related to iron deficiency, though other minerals (zinc, for one) may be implicated. Of course, various complications can ensue, among them lead toxicity and the ingestion of various parasites that live in soil and other inedible matter. The behavior is sometimes recognized only when the patient comes to surgery for a bowel obstruction. Patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability are especially prone to pica\u2014a risk that increases with the severity of each disorder. Affected chil - dren may come from a background of low socioeconomic status and neglect. The behav- ior usually begins by 2 years of age and remits during adolescence, or when the pre - sumed iron (or other mineral) deficiency is corrected. Note that if pica does occur in the context of another mental or medical disorder, it must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical care. However, the literature is also",
    "years of age and remits during adolescence, or when the pre - sumed iron (or other mineral) deficiency is corrected. Note that if pica does occur in the context of another mental or medical disorder, it must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical care. However, the literature is also replete with examples of people whose abnormal dietary intake began when they were already grown. Pica often runs through the fam - ily histories of affected adults, whose own history may have begun when they were chil- dren. It has traditionally been associated with pregnancy (though a prevalence of only 0.02% was found in a survey of pregnant Danish women), but is also found in patients with schizophrenia. 288 FEEDING AND EATING DISO rDErS Medical specialists tend to think of pica as rare, but you\u2019ll find a lot of it if you investigate the right population. For example, it was diagnosed in a majority of patients who presented with gastrointestinal blood loss that led to iron- deficiency anemia. Pag- ophagia (ice craving\u2014no, not ice carving ) is especially common among patients with iron deficiency. In such instances, as well as in cases of schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, before you made the diagnosis, you\u2019d have to persuade yourself that the patient needed additional clinical attention as the result of the pica. Derived from the magpie, a black-and-white bird whose scientific genus is Pica, this term for a type of abnormal eating behavior dates back at least 400 years. Perhaps someone watching actual magpies collect mud for nests assumed that they were eating it. as far as four millennia ago and across countless cultures, humans have chewed and swallowed clay. Researchers don\u2019t know why it happens; hypotheses include a putative detoxifying role of clay and micronutrients absorbed from the clay. Essential Features of Pica The patient persists in eating dirt or something else that isn\u2019t food.

But in humans it is abnormal and potentially problematic, and it is called rumi - nation disorder (RD). It is also uncommon, most often developing in infants after they begin eating solid foods. Boys are more often affected than are girls. Most people who ruminate will later reswallow the food. Some, however\u2014 especially infants and those with intellectual disability\u2014 instead spit it out, risking malnutrition, failure to thrive (in infants), and vulnerability to disease. Mortality rates as high as 25% have been reported. RD can go undiagnosed for years, perhaps because we don\u2019t think to ask. The cause isn\u2019t known, though the usual suspects have been suggested. Possible etiologies include the organic (it may be a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux), the psy- chological (it may reflect a disordered mother\u2013baby relationship), and the behavioral (it may be reinforced by the attention it attracts). Of individuals with intellectual disability who live in institutions, 6\u201310% are some- times affected; an occasional adult without such disability has been reported. RD has also been associated with bulimia nervosa, though patients with both disorders are less likely to reswallow the food. In most cases the behavior subsides spontaneously, though it can persist throughout life. Reportedly, one such adult ruminator was Samuel Johnson, the 18th- century lexicographer whose acquaintances commented on his \u201ccud- chewing\u201d behavior. Note that, like pica (and a host of other conditions throughout the chapters of DSM-5), RD that occurs in the context of another mental or medical disorder must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical care. RD and pica are two of a relatively few DSM-5 conditions that require no criteria for clinical significance. That is, unless they occur in the context of another mental disorder, there is no requirement for some statement of harm, distress, additional investigation, or impaired functioning to the patient or to other people. Therefore, there isn\u2019t any bright line separat- ing the behavior from what\u2019s normal. Essential Features of rumination",

DSM-IV placed them with other disorders that typically begin in childhood. Welcome home, pica and RD! F50.8 [307.59] Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Many young children (nearly half) experience some degree of difficulty with feed - ing, but most outgrow it. Those who don\u2019t may have a form of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), the latest iteration of what used to be called feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The new name reflects the fact that we don\u2019t really know why some patients eat too little to remain healthy, only that it happens\u2014and not always early in childhood. The behavior may commence in the context of parent\u2013child conflict centered around eating. Neglect, abuse, and parental psychopathology (depression, anxiety states, or personality disorders, for example) have also been adduced as causes. How - ever, the vast majority are probably due to some sort of medical disorder. Among these are physical barriers to the act of chewing and swallowing and hypersensitivity to cer - tain aspects of food such as texture, taste, and appearance. Indeed, DSM-5 encourages us to notice that children with ARFID fall into three principal categories: those who basically don\u2019t care about eating; those who restrict their diet due to sensory issues (certain foods are just unappetizing); and those who don\u2019t eat because of an unpleasant experience (perhaps they\u2019ve choked when trying to swallow). In any case, the conse - quences of the behavior extend this definition well beyond the everyday picky eater. Most children with ARFID are under the age of 6, but could even an adult ever be so diagnosed? There\u2019s nothing in the DSM-5 criteria to prevent it, but you won\u2019t find examples thick on the ground.

Essential Features of Avoidant/restrictive Food Intake Disorder With no abnormality of self-image, the patient eats too little to maintain adequate nutrition or weight (for children, to grow or gain weight). As a result, the patient may need tube feeding or added nourishment. Social and personal life may also be disrupted.

(It is also critically important to make sure that such a patient doesn\u2019t have another definitive condition, such as a mood disorder, schizophre- nia, somatic symptom disorder, or any disorder caused by another medical condition.) Below are several that can be specified by name, following the \u201cother specified\u201d num - bers and label. Atypical anorexia nervosa. Some patients lose considerable weight, fear becoming fat, and believe they look fat, yet their weight remains normal. Bulimia nervosa (of low frequency or limited duration). A patient who fulfills most criteria for bulimia nervosa doesn\u2019t binge often or long enough to meet the time criteria. Night eating syndrome. Episodes of binge eating occur at night while the patient is in some stage of sleep; the next day, the patient may forget doing so. Purging disorder. Without binge eating, the patient repeatedly engages in purging behavior (intentionally vomits or uses drugs) to affect weight or appearance.

At the age of 4 years or later, the patient repeatedly passes feces into inappropri- ate places (p. 294). Enuresis. At the age of 5 years or later, there is repeated voiding of urine (it can be voluntary or involuntary) into bedding or clothing (p. 293). Introduction Encopresis and enuresis most often occur separately, but sometimes they travel together, especially in a child who has been seriously neglected or emotionally deprived. You can encounter either diagnosis as primary (symptoms have been present throughout the child\u2019s development) or as secondary (toilet training was initially successful). Abnor - malities of the genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal tracts are often suspected but only rarely found, so that a careful medical history is usually enough to help you make the correct diagnosis. F98.0 [307.6] Enuresis By a ratio of 4:1, primary enuresis (the child has never been dry) is more common than secondary enuresis. It is limited to bedwetting; daytime bladder control is unaffected. Parents of children referred to a mental health professional have usually tried the com- mon remedies\u2014fluid restriction before bedtime, midnight toilet use\u2014 without success. Because the children typically wet several times a week, they are too embarrassed to sleep over with friends. In some children, enuresis is associated with non-rapid eye movement sleep, which occurs especially during the first 3 hours of sleep. In others, trauma such as hospitaliza- tion or separation from parents may precipitate secondary enuresis, which can occur more than once per night or randomly throughout the period of sleep. Although some enuretic children have urinary tract infections or physical anomalies (which would mean that we wouldn\u2019t make the diagnosis of enuresis), for most the etiology remains unknown. Although the formal criteria state that the wetting can be done on purpose, it is accidental and embarrassing for the vast majority of children. There are strong genetic ties: About three- fourths of affected children have a first- degree relative with a history of enuresis. Having two enuretic parents strongly pre - dicts that a child will be affected. Before age 6, boys and girls are about equally represented (overall, around 5\u201310% of young children are affected). In older children, enuresis is more frequent in boys.",

Before age 6, boys and girls are about equally represented (overall, around 5\u201310% of young children are affected). In older children, enuresis is more frequent in boys. The prevalence falls off with maturation, so that it affects only about 1% of adolescents. Adults who wet the bed are likely to continue doing so lifelong.

There are two types. One is associated with chronic constipa- tion, which causes fissures around the anus. Defecation therefore causes pain, which the child seeks to forestall by withholding stool. Then the stool hardens (worsening the fissures), and liquid feces leak from the impacted rectum into clothing and bedclothes. The less common type, without constipation, is often a matter of secrecy and denial. Children hide their otherwise normal stools in unusual locations\u2014behind the 294 ELIMINATION DISOrDErS toilet, in bureau drawers\u2014and then claim not to know how they got there. Encopresis without constipation is often associated with stress and other family psychopathology. Some of these children may have been abused physically or sexually. Encopresis affects about 1% of elementary school-age children; boys predominate by a 6:1 ratio. Essential Features of Encopresis The patient recurrently defecates in improper locations or in clothes.

In this Quick Guide, I have arranged the disorders rather differently from DSM-5\u2019s ordering, in order to emphasize the most prevalent underlying diagnoses. (I know it\u2019s boring, but the page number following each item indicates where a more detailed discussion begins.) Sleeping Too Little (Insomnia) Insomnia is often a symptom; sometimes it is a presenting complaint. Only occasionally is it a diagnosis independent of a major mental disorder or another medical condition (see sidebar, p. 301). I can\u2019t overstate how important it is to evaluate first whether another mental disorder or medical condition could be the cause of insomnia. Insomnia disorder. It can be comorbid with a medical condition (p. 301), primary (when there\u2019s no discernible cause; p. 307), or comorbid with another sleep disorder or mental dis- order (p. 303). The last is most often encountered in patients suffering from major depres- sive episodes (p. 122), manic episodes (p. 129), or even panic attacks (p. 173). Substance/medication- induced sleep\u2013wake disorder, insomnia type. Most of the commonly misused psychoactive substances, as well as a variety of prescription medicines, can interfere with sleep (p. 346). Sleep apnea. Although most patients with breathing problems such as sleep apnea complain of hypersomnia, some instead have insomnia. Three principal types are listed: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep- related hypoventilation (pp. 318, 321). Sleeping Too Much (Hypersomnolence) You might think that the term hypersomnia means only that a patient sleeps too much. However, it can also indicate drowsiness at a time when the patient should be alert. A new word, hypersomnolence, has been introduced to make sure that we\u2019re thinking of both meanings. Hypersomnolence disorder.",

A new word, hypersomnolence, has been introduced to make sure that we\u2019re thinking of both meanings. Hypersomnolence disorder. Excessive drowsiness or sleepiness can accompany mental or medical disorders, or other sleep disorders; sometimes it\u2019s primary (p. 309). Narcolepsy. These people experience a crushing need to sleep, regardless of time of day, causing them to fall asleep almost instantly\u2014 sometimes, even when standing. They may also have sleep paralysis, sudden loss of strength (cataplexy), and hallucinations as they fall asleep or awaken (p. 313). Substance/medication- induced sleep\u2013wake disorder, daytime sleepiness type. The use of a substance is less likely to produce hypersomnolence than insomnia, but it can happen (p. 346). Sleep apnea. What DSM-5 calls breathing- related sleep disorders commonly result in day - time drowsiness. Three principal types are listed, as noted above for insomnia (pp. 318, 321). Circadian Rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorders There\u2019s a mismatch between someone\u2019s biological clock and the environment. Five principal subtypes are listed: Delayed sleep phase type. Falling asleep and waking later than desired (p. 324). Advanced sleep phase type. Falling asleep and waking earlier than desired (p. 324). Irregular sleep\u2013wake type. Falling asleep and waking at irregular times (p. 325). Non-24-hour sleep\u2013wake type. Falling asleep and waking (usually) progressively later than desired (p. 324). Shift work type. Sleepiness associated with changes in work schedule (p. 325). Jet lag. Feeling sleepy or \u201chung over\u201d after crossing time zones is no longer considered a sleep disorder; it\u2019s a physiological fact of modern life. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve covered it briefly in a sidebar (p. 323). Parasomnias and Other Disorders of Sleep In these disorders, something abnormal happens in association with sleep (or the stages of sleep), or during the times when the patient is falling asleep or waking up. Quick Guide to the Sleep\u2013Wake Disorders 297 Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep arousal disorder, sleep terror type. These patients cry out in apparent fear during the first part of the night. Often they don\u2019t really wake up at all. This behavior is considered pathological only in adults, not children (p. 333). Non-REM sleep arousal disorder, sleepwalking type. Persistent sleepwalking usually occurs early in the night (p. 331).

Persistent sleepwalking usually occurs early in the night (p. 331). Non-REM sleep arousal disorder, confusional arousals. Patients partially awaken, but they don\u2019t walk about and don\u2019t appear fearful. This isn\u2019t an official DSM-5 disorder, but people experience it anyway (p. 335). Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. These patients awaken from REM sleep to speak or thrash about, sometimes injuring themselves or bed partners (p. 343). Nightmare disorder. Bad dreams trouble some people more than others (p. 340). Restless legs syndrome. The irresistible need to move one\u2019s legs during periods of inactivity (especially evenings/nights) leads to fatigue and other behavioral/emotional sequels (p. 336). Substance/medication- induced sleep\u2013wake disorder, parasomnia type. Alcohol and other substances (during intoxication or withdrawal) can cause various problems with sleep (p. 346). Other specified, or unspecified, sleep disorder. These categories are for problems of insom- nia, hypersomnolence, or general sleep issues that cannot be fitted into any of the catego- ries above (p. 349). Introduction Sleep is basic behavior for humans, as for all other animals. Keep in mind these points about the normal sleep of humans: 1. Normality takes in a wide range. This refers to the amount of sleep, how long it takes to fall asleep and to awaken, and what happens in between. 2. When sleep is abnormal, it can have profound consequences for health. 3. An individual\u2019s sleep changes throughout the life cycle. Everyone knows that babies sleep most of the time. As people age, they take more time to fall asleep, they require less sleep, and they awaken more often throughout the night. I\u2019ve heard it said that 9-year-olds sleep the best of anyone. Too bad: Everyone read- ing this is over the hill, sleep-wise. 4. Sleep isn\u2019t uniform; it varies in depth and quality throughout the night. The 298 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS two principal phases of sleep are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, during which most dreaming takes place, and non-REM sleep. Various disorders can be related to these phases of sleep. 5. Many people who sleep less soundly or more briefly than they think they should don\u2019t have an actual disorder of sleep. 6.

    "sleep. Various disorders can be related to these phases of sleep. 5. Many people who sleep less soundly or more briefly than they think they should don\u2019t have an actual disorder of sleep. 6. Even today, sleep disorder criteria are based principally upon clinical find - ings. EEG and other sleep laboratory studies may be confirmatory, but they are required for diagnosis in just a few of the conditions described here. Sleep specialists divide sleep disorders into dyssomnias and parasomnias. a patient with a dyssomnia sleeps too little, too much, or at the wrong time, but the sleep itself\u2014what there is of it\u2014is pretty normal. In a parasomnia , the quality, quantity, and timing of sleep are essentially normal. b ut something abnormal happens during sleep itself, or during the times when the patient is falling asleep or waking up; motor, cognitive, or autonomic nervous system processes become active during sleep or during the transitions between sleep and wakefulness, and all hell breaks loose. consider, for example, sleep apnea (dyssomnia) versus nightmares (parasomnia). both occur during sleep, but nightmares are usually problematic because they are scary, not because they interfere with sleeping or impair wakefulness the next day, as is often the case with sleep apnea. Sleeping Too Much or Too Little F51.01 [307.42] Insomnia Disorder What most of us understand by insomnia is this: sleep that is too brief or is unrestful. Some people with insomnia may not realize just how tense they are. Some cases may start as insomnia secondary to another medical condition, such as pain from a broken hip. The hip heals, but the patient has become accustomed to the idea of being unable to sleep at night. In other words, insomnia can be learned behavior. Indeed, many medical illnesses can lead to the symptoms of insomnia disorder. Some patients with insomnia may use their beds for activities other than sleeping or having sex\u2014eating and watching TV, for example. These associations condition them to be wakeful when they are in bed; it\u2019s part of what clinicians call poor sleep hygiene . These patients may discover the source of the problem when their sleep improves dur- ing weekends, during holidays, or on a vacation, when they\u2019ve escaped their usual hab- its and habitats. Whatever the cause, insomnia can persist forever if it isn\u2019t effectively addressed. Insomnia disorder (ID) is found especially in older patients and in women.",
    "source of the problem when their sleep improves dur- ing weekends, during holidays, or on a vacation, when they\u2019ve escaped their usual hab- its and habitats. Whatever the cause, insomnia can persist forever if it isn\u2019t effectively addressed. Insomnia disorder (ID) is found especially in older patients and in women. Many people complain of unrefreshing (or nonrestorative) sleep, or of being awake, Insomnia Disorder 299 when their bed partners swear they have slept all night. For this reason, the state - ment that insomnia is \u201csleeping too little\u201d still isn\u2019t quite right; rather, insomnia is the complaint of sleeping too little. But these people do have problems that should not be belittled. Giving them time to state what is on their minds is important in seeking the etiology of their difficulties. Note that the definition of ID requires that the patient experience clinically important distress or disability as a result. Although the distress may be experienced during the nighttime, any resulting disability is most likely to be experienced during the daytime\u2014 reduced effectiveness at work, interpersonal conflict at home, daytime fatigue and sleepiness, and the like. Anyone who complains of difficulty sleeping, but who does not report distress or disability, should not receive the diagnosis of ID. Even with those restrictions, that still leaves up to 10% of the adult population affected by ID. It is a bit more common among women than men. DSM-5 specifies that we should use the diagnosis of ID for any patient who fulfills the diagnostic criteria, whether or not there is a coexisting mental, medical, or other sleep\u2013wake disorder\u2014as long as the patient\u2019s ID is sufficiently serious that it requires independent clinical attention. I\u2019ll illustrate with three vignettes. Essential Features of Insomnia Disorder It\u2019s mainly quality or amount of sleep that causes complaint: trouble getting to sleep, staying asleep, or awaking too early without again falling asleep. Occasionally, sleep is just plain not refreshing. The following day, the patient feels fatigued, grumpy, or has poor concentration or otherwise impaired functioning.

Such patients are probably a tiny minority of those a mental health professional encounters. Perhaps these people are more likely to seek help from a primary medical care provider. a lthough texts say that persistent insomnia is fairly common, they must seek treatment from family practitioners or internists: of over 15,000 mental health patients I have examined, exactly 1 had what I considered primary ID (without another medical or mental disorder). Insomnia Disorder, with Other Medical Comorbidity Many medical illnesses are associated with sleep problems (mostly insomnia). Such problems are usually ones of restlessness, increased sleep onset latency, and frequent awakenings during the night. The medical issues cited\u2014which can produce discomfort day or night\u2014 include the following: \u2022\u2022 Fever resulting from a variety of infections. \u2022\u2022 Pain caused by headache (especially some migraines), rheumatoid arthritis, can- cer, persistent nocturnal penile erections, or angina. \u2022\u2022 Itching caused by a variety of systemic and skin disorders. \u2022\u2022 Breathing problems resulting from asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), restricted lung capacity (due to obesity, pregnancy, or spinal deformities), or cystic fibrosis. \u2022\u2022 Endocrine and metabolic diseases, including hyperthyroidism, liver failure, and kidney disease. \u2022\u2022 Sleeping in one position enforced, for example, by wearing a cast. \u2022\u2022 Neuromuscular disorders, such as muscular dystrophy and poliomyelitis. \u2022\u2022 Movement and other neurological disorders, such as Huntington\u2019s disease, tor - sion dystonia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and some seizure disorders.

His wife, Edith, accompanied him to the appointment. Together, they ran a \u201cmom and pop\u201d grocery store. Several years earlier, Hoyle had learned that he had emphysema. A series of pul - monary function tests had prompted his doctor to ask him to quit smoking. After 3 weeks, he had gained 10 pounds and couldn\u2019t concentrate well enough to add up the receipts from the store each night. \u201cI was depressed and uptight, and I couldn\u2019t sleep 2 hours without waking up and wanting a cigarette,\u201d said Hoyle. \u201cI begged him to start smoking again,\u201d said Edith. \u201cWhen he did, it was a relief for both of us.\u201d Hoyle quit seeing the doctor, and his sleep returned to normal. Within the past few months, however, he\u2019d begun awakening several times during the course of the night. Some nights this happened as often as every hour. He felt restless and uncomfortable, with some of the same anxiety he\u2019d experienced the time he tried to quit smoking. A few times he tried sitting on the edge of the bed to have a cigarette, but it didn\u2019t seem to help. And anyway, Edith complained about the smell of smoke in the night. They still ran their grocery, and Hoyle was having no trouble at all with his columns of figures. He never drank more than a single beer, usually in the afternoon. \u201cWaking up doesn\u2019t bother him much,\u201d Edith complained. \u201cHe usually goes right back to sleep again. He doesn\u2019t even feel sleepy the next day.

Evaluation of Hoyle Garner Hoyle\u2019s main problem was with sleep, which showed up as frequent awakenings, sev - eral times every night, for months (ID criteria A2, C, D) despite sufficient opportunities 302 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS for sleep (E). Although for him the effects were less than earth- shaking (insomnia due to COPD typically doesn\u2019t produce daytime drowsiness), his wife complained quite a lot. And the effect of someone\u2019s insomnia on a bed partner or caregiver is one of the symptoms that tells us we have a problem deserving consideration (B). The features of Hoyle\u2019s insomnia would not suggest a severe mood disorder, which could produce early morning awakening. Besides, a mild mood disorder, or adjust - ment disorder with depressed mood, is typically associated with trouble falling asleep. Based on Edith\u2019s observations of his sleep, Hoyle did not have (F) a variety of narco - lepsy or sleep apnea (do check for sleep apnea in any patient with insomnia with other medical comorbidity; a small number will have two disorders). He was taking no medi- cations at the time, but many patients with medical illnesses will be doing that; then, you\u2019ll have to rule out substance- induced insomnia. Hoyle also had tobacco use disorder, which was probably responsible for the emphysema in the first place; it would be hard to attribute his insomnia to a physiologi- cal consequence of nicotine (G). When he was trying to quit smoking, he clearly expe- rienced tobacco withdrawal, and he continued to smoke despite his COPD (see p. 461). I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 61. His complete diagnosis would be as follows: F51.01 [307.42] Insomnia disorder, with pulmonary emphysema, persistent J43.9 [492.8] Pulmonary emphysema F17.200 [305.1] Tobacco use disorder, moderate note that DSM-5",

His complete diagnosis would be as follows: F51.01 [307.42] Insomnia disorder, with pulmonary emphysema, persistent J43.9 [492.8] Pulmonary emphysema F17.200 [305.1] Tobacco use disorder, moderate note that DSM-5 no longer asks us to specify whether insomnia is \u201cdue to\u201d a comorbid physical or mental disorder. It is enough to say that they coexist. That\u2019s because it can be extraordinarily difficult to determine whether one has actually caused the other. We are allowed (indeed, encouraged) to diagnose any disorder whose symptoms are severe enough to justify independent clinical attention. Insomnia Disorder, with Non-Sleep Disorder Mental Comorbidity When it is a symptom of some other mental disorder, insomnia is often directly pro - portional to the severity of the other diagnosis. And, logically enough, sleep usually improves with resolution of the underlying condition. Meanwhile, patients sometimes abuse hypnotic and other medications. Here\u2019s a brief overview: Major depressive episodes. Insomnia is probably most often a symptom of a mood disorder. In fact, sleep disturbance may be one of the earliest symptoms of depres- sion. Insomnia is especially likely to affect depressed elderly patients. In severe depression, terminal insomnia (awakening early in the morning and being unable to get back to sleep) is characteristic\u2014and a truly miserable experience. Insomnia Disorder 303 Trauma- and stressor- related disorders. Criteria for acute stress disorder and for posttraumatic stress disorder specifically mention sleep disturbance as a symptom. Panic disorder. Panic attacks may occur during sleep. Adjustment disorder. Patients who have developed anxiety or depression in response to a specific stressor may lie awake worrying about a particular stressor or the day\u2019s events. Somatic symptom disorder. Many somatizing patients will complain of problems with sleep, especially initial and interval insomnia. Cognitive disorders. Most demented patients have some degree of sleep distur - bance. Typically, this involves interval awakening: They will wander at night and suffer from reduced alertness during the day. Manic and hypomanic episodes. In a 24-hour period, manic and hypomanic patients typically sleep less than they do when they are euthymic. However, they do not complain of insomnia. They feel rested and ready for more activity; it\u2019s their families and friends who become concerned (and fatigued). If such patients do complain, it is usually of lengthened sleep onset latency\u2014the time it takes to fall asleep.",
    "they do when they are euthymic. However, they do not complain of insomnia. They feel rested and ready for more activity; it\u2019s their families and friends who become concerned (and fatigued). If such patients do complain, it is usually of lengthened sleep onset latency\u2014the time it takes to fall asleep. Schizophrenia. When they are becoming ill, delusions, hallucinations, or anxiety may keep patients with schizophrenia preoccupied later and later into the night. Total sleep time may remain constant, but they arise progressively later, until most of their sleeping occurs during the day. DSM-5 doesn\u2019t provide a way to code a circadian rhythm sleep\u2013wake disorder related to a mental disorder; ID related to schizophrenia (or, perhaps, other specified insomnia disorder) would be about the best we could do. Obsessive\u2013 compulsive personality disorder. This personality disorder is com - monly cited as associated with insomnia. anxiety or mania may mask an insomnia that occurs in the course of another mental dis - order. Patients may not recognize a sleep deficit until they fall asleep at the wheel or suffer an industrial accident. On the other hand, there\u2019s a risk that clinicians could focus on the problem with sleep and underdiagnose the associated mental problem. Sal Camozzi \u201cI\u2019m just not getting enough sleep to play.\u201d Sal Camozzi was a third-year student who attended a small liberal arts college in southern California on a football scholarship. 304 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS Now it was early November, midway through the season, and he didn\u2019t think he could maintain the effort. He had always kept regular hours and \u201ceaten healthy,\u201d but for over a month he had been awakening at 2:30 every morning. \u201cI might as well be setting an alarm,\u201d he said. \u201cMy eyes snap open and there I am, worrying about the next game, or passing chemistry, or whatever. I\u2019m only getting 5 hours at night, and I\u2019ve always needed 8. I\u2019m getting desperate.\u201d For a while Sal had tried over-the- counter sleep medications. They helped a little, but mainly they made him feel groggy the next day. He gave them up; he had always avoided alcohol and drugs, and hated the feeling of chemicals in his body. Sal had had something of the same problem the previous fall, and the one before that. Then he\u2019d had the same difficulty with sleep; his appetite had fallen off, too. Nei- ther time had things been as",
    "avoided alcohol and drugs, and hated the feeling of chemicals in his body. Sal had had something of the same problem the previous fall, and the one before that. Then he\u2019d had the same difficulty with sleep; his appetite had fallen off, too. Nei- ther time had things been as severe as now, however. (This year he had already lost 10 pounds; as a linebacker, he needed to keep his weight up.) Sal also complained that he just didn\u2019t seem to enjoy life in general the way he usually did. Although his interest in football and his concentration on the field had diminished, it hadn\u2019t been as bad last year, and he had finished the season with respectable statistics. One summer during high school, Sal had felt listless and slept too much. He\u2019d been tested for infectious mononucleosis and found to be physically well. He was his normal self by the time school started that fall. Last spring and the one before had been a different matter. When Sal went out for baseball, he seemed to explode with energy, batted .400, and played every game. He didn\u2019t sleep much then, either, when he came to think of it, though 5 hours a night had seemed plenty. \u201cI had loads of energy and never felt happier in my life. I felt like another Babe Ruth.\u201d The coach had noted that Sal had been \u201cterrific during baseball season, all hustle, but he talked too much. Why doesn\u2019t he put the same effort into football?\u201d Primary (as in a primary insomnia) is one of those funny words that have taken on mean - ings different from that which most speakers of English understand. In the clinical world, primary means an illness or symptom for which no cause can be found. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a cause; it\u2019s just that no one\u2019s sure what it is. In this context, primary doesn\u2019t mean that one condition is more important than another, or that one begins earlier than something else. (The World Health Organization also uses primary to mean a disorder that attacks the brain directly or preferentially, as opposed to those that attack the brain only as one of several body organs or systems.) The DSM-5 doesn\u2019t use primary in any official sense at all, but clinicians do, to differentiate disorders for which we can state a cause from those for",
    "attacks the brain directly or preferentially, as opposed to those that attack the brain only as one of several body organs or systems.) The DSM-5 doesn\u2019t use primary in any official sense at all, but clinicians do, to differentiate disorders for which we can state a cause from those for which we can\u2019t. clinicians also use the term functional to describe disorders for which they can find no basis in brain anatomy, chemistry, or physiology. Most mood disorders and psychoses are called functional ; that is, we still don\u2019t know why or how they have developed. If you think this is confusing, consider some of the other words deployed throughout the medi- Insomnia Disorder 305 cal world to mean \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea what\u2019s behind it\u201d: essential, as in essential hypertension; idiopathic, as in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; cryptogenic (literally, \u201chidden cause\u201d). Sometimes we say psychogenic , which gives the illusion that we have found the cause, but that it\u2019s often only in our minds (or dreams). no wonder clinicians in training don\u2019t sleep well. Evaluation of Sal Camozzi From Sal\u2019s history, his sleep disorder wasn\u2019t related to substance use or to any physical illness. There was similarly no evidence for another sleep disorder. Sal\u2019s sleep difficulty was actually only the tip of his depressive iceberg. The first thing to look for would be other symptoms of a major depressive episode. Although he didn\u2019t complain of feeling depressed in so many words, he did report a general loss of zest for life. Besides that and the insomnia, Sal had also lost his appetite, interest, and concentration. Together, his symptoms would barely meet criteria for a major depres - sive episode. The history did not touch on death wishes or suicidal ideas; it should have. Besides depression, the obvious episodes of high mood would need to be consid - ered in the diagnosis. Sal had had several periods when he felt unusually happy, his energy level increased, he talked a great deal, and his need for sleep fell off. Especially in contrast to his present mood, his self- esteem was markedly increased (he noted that he \u201cfelt like Babe Ruth\u201d). This change in his mood was pronounced enough that others noticed and commented on it, but it did not compromise his functioning or require hos- pitalization\u2014if so, we\u2019d instead have diagnosed a manic episode. His symptoms would fulfill criteria for a",

This change in his mood was pronounced enough that others noticed and commented on it, but it did not compromise his functioning or require hos- pitalization\u2014if so, we\u2019d instead have diagnosed a manic episode. His symptoms would fulfill criteria for a hypomanic episode. All of this adds up to a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder (see p. 135); Sal\u2019s current episode would of course be depressed. He would nearly meet criteria for the specifier with melancholic features , but his history of repeated depressions beginning in the same season of the year (fall) and consistently either resolving or switching to hypoma- nia during another season (spring) would be typical for the specifier with seasonal pat- tern. Although Sal may have had one episode of depression when he was in high school that did not fit this pattern, most of the episodes did, which is the requirement. And the last 2 years fit the mold exactly. Sal\u2019s sleeplessness would have been clinically significant even without the bipolar II disorder (ID criteria A, B), since it caused fatigue and occurred several nights a week (C). But here\u2019s the rub: It had persisted for just over a month\u2014 perhaps 60 days shy of the 3 months required by DSM-5 for ID. Now Sal fit the DSM-IV criteria, and Sal hasn\u2019t changed; only the criteria have. What to do? To me, it seems unreasonable that a person who has a disorder that, by defini - tion, is relatively short-lived (patients with seasonal mood disturbance become ill and recover with the seasons) cannot qualify for the additional diagnosis of ID. So, with the understanding that the criteria are only guidelines, not handcuffs, I\u2019m going to stick 306 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS with my original evaluation of Sal. Whether you agree with or reject my judgment, his case can still help guide us through the maze of the diagnostic criteria. (If you do dis - agree, you could code his sleep disorder as G47.09 [780.52], other specified insomnia disorder, brief insomnia disorder.) Sal\u2019s GAF score would be 55. We are instructed to list the associated mental (or medical) disorder right after the sleep disorder, so as to make the association clear. I wanted to list first the mood disorder, because it is the more critical to treat, but at least I did put them contiguously. (OK, it\u2019s hard",
    "We are instructed to list the associated mental (or medical) disorder right after the sleep disorder, so as to make the association clear. I wanted to list first the mood disorder, because it is the more critical to treat, but at least I did put them contiguously. (OK, it\u2019s hard to do otherwise when there are only two items to list.) F31.81 [296.89] Bipolar II disorder, depressed, with seasonal pattern F51.01 [307.42] Insomnia disorder, with bipolar II disorder To a considerable extent, it\u2019s a matter of taste whether to diagnose a sleep disorder that occurs with another mental condition. DSM-5 notes that this is appropriate when the prob- lem with sleep is serious enough to justify an evaluation in its own right. If the patient\u2019s presenting complaint is the sleep problem, I\u2019d consider it evidence of clinical importance. However, these situations are often unclear and usually require judgment. In the example of a mood disorder, any problem with sleep is almost certainly a symptom that will resolve once the depression has been adequately treated. Therefore, no one could be faulted for diagnosing only the mood disorder. [Primary] Insomnia Disorder Another type of ID\u2014in which the person has no apparent other condition to which the insomnia can be attributed\u2014is actually the one most often diagnosed. Still, the \u201cplain vanilla\u201d type should be one of exclusion, used only after other possibilities (including insomnia caused by substance use; see p. 346) have been ruled out. Just because we cannot discern the cause of insomnia, of course, doesn\u2019t mean there is no cause; it\u2019s just that we cannot pinpoint it. Sometimes insomnia may start because noise or some other stimulus inhibits sleep. (When sleeplessness is due to a noisy environment or one otherwise not conducive to sleep, it isn\u2019t technically insom - nia. It\u2019s called, would you believe, environmental sleep disorder\u2014but not by DSM-5.) Another contributing factor is being active right up until bedtime. Vigorous exer - cise and arguments are just two of the sort of activities that can promote sleeplessness; people need quiet time to get into a relaxed frame of mind needed for sleep onset. Once insomnia is underway, muscle tension from lying awake and persistent negative thoughts (\u201cI\u2019m a terrible sleeper\u201d) perpetuate the problem. The result is hours of frus - tration at night, plus fatigue and dysphoria the following day. How often does this type\u2014it used to be called",

The result is hours of frus - tration at night, plus fatigue and dysphoria the following day. How often does this type\u2014it used to be called primary insomnia \u2014occur? No one really knows. Though perhaps a quarter of adults are unhappy with their sleep, Insomnia Disorder 307 probably a percentage down in the single digits would qualify for an ID diagnosis. It is especially found in older people and in women. Over time, it can vary, but it usually follows a chronic course. Curtis Usher \u201cIt\u2019s almost spooky. It doesn\u2019t seem to make any difference what time I go to bed\u20149:30, 10:00, 10:30. Whatever, my eyes click open at 2:00 in the morning, and that\u2019s it for the rest of the night.\u201d Curtis Usher had had this problem off and on for years. Recently, it was more often on. \u201cActually, I guess it\u2019s usually the worst during the week. Whenever I lie there, I\u2019m worrying about work.\u201d Curtis was a project manager at an advertising agency. It was a wonderful job when times were flush, which they hadn\u2019t been for several years. Curtis\u2019s boss was a bit of a tyrant, who enjoyed saying that he didn\u2019t have headaches; he caused them. Curtis didn\u2019t have headaches, but he didn\u2019t get much sleep, either. At age 53, Curtis was a healthy man of regular habits. He had lived alone since his wife divorced him 3 years earlier, with the complaint that he was dull. Occasionally his current girlfriend stayed overnight in his studio apartment, but most evenings he spent lying on his bed watching public television until he couldn\u2019t stay awake any longer. He never drank or used drugs, and his mood was good; neither he nor anyone else in his family had ever had any mental health problems. \u201cI don\u2019t take naps during the day,\u201d Curtis summed up, \u201cbut I might as well. I\u2019m sure not getting much done at work.\u201d Evaluation of Curtis Usher Curtis clearly had trouble sleeping\u2014it would seem to include both initial and terminal components (ID criteria A1, A3)\u2014that had lasted far longer than the required 3 months (D).

    "had trouble sleeping\u2014it would seem to include both initial and terminal components (ID criteria A1, A3)\u2014that had lasted far longer than the required 3 months (D). From what Curtis related, it occurred several times a week (C) and was reducing his efficiency at work (B). Other than an occasional sleepover with his girlfriend, no other information suggests circumstances that would interfere with his opportunities for sleep (E). The real challenge is to decide whether Curtis\u2019s insomnia was stand-alone or whether we would need to include in our coding some underlying problem that was destroying his sleep. Although the vignette doesn\u2019t cover every possibility, it does touch upon some of the major points. Curtis probably did not have another mental disorder (H). His mood had been too good for a major depressive episode. Although he worried about work, we have no information to suggest that he had the wide- ranging anxiety typical of generalized anxiety disorder. He didn\u2019t drink or use drugs (G); there is no information to exclude a personality disorder, but these are probably infrequent as a sole cause of a sleep disorder. 308 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS We have only Curtis\u2019s own word on his good health to confirm that he did not have another medical condition (also criterion H); his clinician should refer him for a medical evaluation. What about other sleep disorders (F)? Curtis didn\u2019t nap, which would seem to rule out narcolepsy. Sleep apnea also seems unlikely: his former wife had cited dullness, not snoring, among her complaints. Circadian rhythm sleep\u2013wake disorder, delayed sleep phase type would result in awakening late rather than early, and he didn\u2019t get sleepy early, as would be the case with the advanced sleep phase type. The vignette contains no information that would support a parasomnia diagnosis such as nightmare disorder, or a non-REM sleep arousal disorder such as sleep ter - rors or sleepwalking. Two mechanisms could help account for Curtis\u2019s insomnia. His work- related anxi- ety would be one (his boss was demanding, and times were tough in his industry). Alternatively, he often reclined on his bed while watching TV. The association of this waking- related activity with bed (poor sleep hygiene) could be conditioning him to stay awake. Pending the outcome of a medical evaluation, here\u2019s how I\u2019d diagnose Curtis (with a GAF score of 65, with a Z-code to indicate an area that needs work): F51.01 [307.42]",

Like those with this anxiety disorder, patients with ID also lie awake worrying. (The difference is that their anxieties are focused on their inability to sleep as well as think they should.) a lso watch for \u201cmasked depression\u201d: Inquire carefully about other vegetative symptoms (appetite, weight loss) of a major depressive episode when you are evaluating patients who appear to have only ID. F51.11 [307.44] Hypersomnolence Disorder Sleep experts have adopted the term hypersomnolence in place of the familiar hyper - somnia, and here\u2019s why: The new term better describes the fact that these conditions can result either in excessive sleep or in a less-than- optimal quality of wakefulness. The latter includes trouble waking up or remaining fully awake, sometimes called sleep inertia\u2014the sensation of just not being able to fully awaken (or stay that way) when we need to be fully alert. Hypersomnolence disorder (HD) includes conditions of hyper - somnolence that occur with medical, mental, or other sleep disorders, and some that are apparently free- standing. People with HD tend to fall asleep easily and rapidly (often in 5 minutes or less), and they may sleep late the next day. Although total sleep time is likely to be 9 or more hours in 24, they may feel so chronically tired and sleepy that even after a normal Hypersomnolence Disorder 309 night\u2019s sleep they take daytime naps. These tend to be long and unrefreshing; they don\u2019t improve things much. Such people tend to have trouble awakening in the morning, and they may be groggy and have peculiar problems with disorientation, memory, and alertness. In their state of reduced alertness, they may behave more or less automati - cally, performing behaviors for which they have poor later recall. Although we don\u2019t have a lot of information about HD, it probably occurs about equally in males and females and begins when they are relatively young, usually in their teens or 20s. It may affect up to 1% of the general",
    "performing behaviors for which they have poor later recall. Although we don\u2019t have a lot of information about HD, it probably occurs about equally in males and females and begins when they are relatively young, usually in their teens or 20s. It may affect up to 1% of the general population. Though the cause of HD isn\u2019t always apparent, there are a number of known asso- ciations. Hypocretin deficiency occurs less often in cases of HD than in narcolepsy with cataplexy, though on average, its level is less than that for the general population. Also common is a gene allele (HLA DQB1*0602, for anyone keeping score at home), though no one is in a position to say that HD is strictly a genetic phenomenon. Some patients with HD may be experiencing difficulty coping with stress; others may be trying to compensate for a sense of something lacking in their lives. In any event, the outcome is total sleep time that far exceeds the norm, causing these people sometimes to take medications. Central nervous system stimulants can help reduce daytime sleepiness; however, tranquilizers are likely to make matters worse. HD can occur with or without medical illnesses or other mental disorders, but we should not diagnose it if it occurs only with another sleep\u2013wake disorder. Essential Features of Hypersomnolence Disorder The patient complains of severe daytime drowsiness even after 7+ hours of sleep, repeatedly naps or falls asleep each day, has difficulty remaining fully awake, or sleeps long (9+ hours a night) but doesn\u2019t sleep well (it isn\u2019t refreshing).

Colin Rodebaugh From the time he was 15, Colin Rodebaugh had dreamed of becoming an architect. He had read biographies of Christopher Wren and Frank Lloyd Wright; in the summers, he worked around construction projects to learn how materials went together. Now he was 23 and in his second year of architectural school, and he couldn\u2019t stay awake dur - ing class. \u201cI might as well have weights tied to my eyelids,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the last 6 months, two or three times a day, I just have to take a nap. It could be in class, any time. It even happened once when I was making love to my girlfriend\u2014not after, but during!\u201d Colin complained that he was tired all the time, but his health appeared to be excellent. His father, a family practitioner in Arizona, had insisted that he have a com- plete physical exam. Colin had been specifically questioned about any history of sudden weakness, loss of consciousness, or seizure disorder, none of which he had had. His mother practiced clinical psychology in Oregon, and she was ready to vouch for his mental health. \u201cI get plenty of sleep at night\u2014at least 9 hours. That\u2019s not the problem. It\u2019s that I hardly ever feel rested, no matter how much sleep I\u2019ve had. If I do take a nap, I wake up feeling almost as groggy as when I nodded off.\u201d Even apart from Colin\u2019s sleep problem, school was a frustration. Although he was technically proficient, he\u2019d discovered that he didn\u2019t have the eye for design of some of his classmates. During the past semester, he had realized that what talent he had lay in drafting, not design. His advisor hadn\u2019t argued with him when they had discussed a possible career change. Evaluation of Colin Rodebaugh As with insomnia, the first task in evaluating hypersomnolence is to rule out the many conditions that could be causing it.

Physical illnesses are probably the most important considerations for this differ - Hypersomnolence Disorder 311 ential diagnosis. Based on a recent workup and physical exam, Colin appeared to be healthy. Furthermore, there had been no history of sudden weakness or lapses of con- sciousness that might indicate psychomotor epilepsy. (According to DSM-5 criterion F, a patient can have a medical condition and still receive a diagnosis of HD, as long as the medical condition doesn\u2019t fully explain the problem with sleep.) We have no infor- mation about substance use (E); Colin\u2019s clinician would have to evaluate that. At least his mother, who was a mental health professional, felt that there was no indication of another mental disorder (also F). Narcolepsy is another sleep disorder that causes daytime sleepiness (D). But such individuals are typically refreshed by their brief naps, whereas Colin felt groggy. His clinician could ask Colin\u2019s girlfriend whether he snored or had other symptoms sugges- tive of sleep apnea. Insufficient nighttime sleep seems so obvious a possibility that it is sometimes overlooked (suspect it in patients who sleep less than 7 hours a night). Colin felt that he got plenty of sleep, and at 9 hours a night or more, we wouldn\u2019t consider him sleep- deprived (A). As far as we can tell from the vignette, Colin\u2019s sleep disorder had lasted about 6 months, and it occurred nearly every day\u2014 certainly every day he was in class (B, C).

In addition, nearly everyone experiences altered cognition: derealization, perplexity, perhaps loss of concentration or memory problems (some patients have com- plete amnesia for the episodes). Patients become churlish or argumentative and irritable, especially if prevented from sleeping. Four out of five have a change in eating behavior: specifically, voracious overeating (way past the point of feeling full), without, however, the purging behavior that is typical of patients with bulimia nervosa. In two out of three cases, speech is also abnormal: Patients become mute or lack spontaneous speech; or they speak only in monosyllables; or speech is slow, slurred, or 312 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS incoherent. nearly half also experience hypersexuality\u2014some expose themselves or mas- turbate openly, or make inappropriate sexual advances to others. at the same time, nearly half report depressed mood, which usually remits at the end of each episode. Indeed, between episodes, nearly all patients appear completely normal. The cause of KLS is unknown. Sometimes it begins with an infection, perhaps one as mild as a cold; some cases are precipitated by a stroke, a tumor, or another neurological disorder such as multiple sclerosis. Episodes last 1\u20133 weeks, and typically recur several times a year. This pattern persists for perhaps 8 years, or an average of 12 episodes. Then, for no apparent reason, just as it began, it often simply disappears. Those who continue to have episodes often find them greatly moderated. If you do see such a patient, write up the case history for publication\u2014and send me a copy. Narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a syndrome of excessive sleepiness that has been recognized since about 1880. The classic presentation includes four symptoms: sleep attacks, cataplexy, hal - lucinations, and sleep paralysis.

    "four symptoms: sleep attacks, cataplexy, hal - lucinations, and sleep paralysis. Most people don\u2019t have all of these symptoms, though the clinical picture can appear strange enough that patients are sometimes mistakenly diagnosed as having a non-sleep- related mental disorder. \u2022\u2022 REM periods begin within a few minutes of the onset of sleep, instead of the usual hour and a half. (In older patients, sleep latency tends to increase.) Often they will even intrude upon the normal waking state, resulting in the irresistible urge to sleep. These sleep attacks tend toward brevity, lasting from a few min - utes to over an hour. In contrast to the grogginess that patients with hypersom- nolence disorder often experience, the sleep is refreshing\u2014except for children, who may awaken feeling tired. Then there follows a refractory period of an hour or more, during which the patient will remain completely awake. Sleep attacks can be triggered by stress or by emotional experiences (usually \u201cpositive\u201d ones, such as jokes and laughter). The resulting daytime drowsiness is often the earli- est complaint of patients with narcolepsy. \u2022\u2022 The most dramatic symptom is cataplexy \u2014a sudden, brief episode of paraly - sis that can affect nearly all voluntary muscles, though sometimes just specific muscle groups, such as the jaw or the knees. When all muscles are affected, the patient may collapse completely. If fewer muscle groups are involved or if the attack is brief, cataplexy may go almost unnoticed. Episodes of cataplexy may occur with sleep attacks, but they can be separate, without loss of consciousness. Often they are precipitated by intense emotion, such as laughter, weeping, or anger, or even by orgasm. Cataplexy usually develops within a few months of the onset of hypersomnia. (Brain lesions such as tumors, infections, or injury Narcolepsy 313 can cause some people to experience cataplexy without having other symptoms of narcolepsy.) Young children, especially those who have been only briefly ill, may not have classical cataplexy; rather, they experience episodes of jaw movement, grimacing, or sticking out of the tongue that can occur even without evi - dence of emotional triggers. These attacks gradually morph into more classical cataplexy. \u2022\u2022 Hallucinations, which are mainly visual, may be the first symptoms of narco - lepsy. They hint that REM sleep is suddenly intruding upon the waking state, because hallucinations occur when the patient is going to sleep or awakening. \u2022\u2022 Sleep paralysis",
    "These attacks gradually morph into more classical cataplexy. \u2022\u2022 Hallucinations, which are mainly visual, may be the first symptoms of narco - lepsy. They hint that REM sleep is suddenly intruding upon the waking state, because hallucinations occur when the patient is going to sleep or awakening. \u2022\u2022 Sleep paralysis can be frightening: The patient has the sensation of being awake but unable to move, speak, or even breathe adequately. Sleep paralysis is associ- ated with anxiety and fear of dying; it usually lasts less than 10 minutes and may be accompanied by visual or auditory hallucinations. REM is a relatively shallow stage of sleep. The acronym stands for rapid eye movement\u2014 behind closed lids, our dreaming eyes track back and forth\u2014which is when most of the dreams that we can recall also occur. During normal REM sleep, our skeletal muscles become paralyzed, which we ordinarily don\u2019t notice because we are safely asleep. REM sleep occurs throughout the night, usually beginning about 90 minutes after we first drop off, and it constitutes 20\u201325% of total sleep time. During REM sleep, heart rate and breathing are irregular; dreams are intense and tend to be remembered; erections of the penis or clitoris occur. A typical history that includes at least three of the four classic symptoms (as described above) is good presumptive evidence for narcolepsy. But because it\u2019s a chronic disorder that can be difficult to manage and implies lifelong treatment, the diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate lab studies. In that regard, the neuropeptide hypo- cretin (sometimes it\u2019s called orexin) has recently been implicated. Produced in the lat- eral hypothalamus, it promotes wakefulness. Patients with narcolepsy often have much less of it than normal, probably because some of the neurons that produce it have been destroyed by an autoimmune process. These findings are robust enough that they have crept into the criteria for this disorder. Strongly hereditary, narcolepsy affects males and females about equally. Though uncommon, it is far from rare, affecting about 1 person in 2,000. It typically starts when the patient is a child or adolescent, but nearly always by the age of 30. Once begun, it usually develops slowly and steadily. It can lead to depression, impotence, trouble at 314 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS work, and even accidents in the street or on the job.

    "by the age of 30. Once begun, it usually develops slowly and steadily. It can lead to depression, impotence, trouble at 314 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS work, and even accidents in the street or on the job. Complications include weight gain and the misuse of substances in an attempt to maintain daytime alertness. Mood disor- ders and generalized anxiety disorder are sometimes comorbid. The italicized word pairs below are nearly homophones, but note carefully the differences. Cataplexy is from Greek, and it means \u201cto strike down\u201d; it is a brief\u2014 usually 2 minutes or less\u2014 symptom of narcolepsy. Catalepsy (\u201cto hold down\u201d) is the prolonged form of immo- bility that occurs in catatonia. Hypnagogic and hypnopompic are two terms widely used to describe events that take place when one is going to sleep or waking up, respectively (Greek: hypn = \u201csleep,\u201d agogue = \u201cleader,\u201d pomp = \u201csending away\u201d). and note the spellings: hypna and hypno\u2014 yet another gift from the Greeks. Essential Features of Narcolepsy The patient cannot resist attacks of daytime sleep, which are associated with cata - plexy (see the preceding sidebar), low cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin, and decreased REM sleep latency on nighttime polysomnography. Cataplexy is usually associated with strong emotion, such as laughter.

Only now it\u2019s worse,\u201d said Eric Flowers, Emma\u2019s husband. He had brought her to the clinic because she no longer felt she could drive safely. Emma herself was slumped in the interview chair next to him. Her chin rested on her chest, and her left arm hung down at her side. She had been soundly asleep for several minutes. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t been sitting down, she\u2019d have fallen down,\u201d said Eric. \u201cI\u2019ve had to catch her half a dozen times.\u201d As a teenager, Emma had had vivid, sometimes frightening dreams that occurred as she was going to sleep, even if it was only a brief afternoon nap. By the time she married Eric, she was having occasional \u201csleep attacks,\u201d when she would find the urge to lie down and take a brief nap irresistible. Over the next several years, these naps became more frequent. Now, at age 28, Emma was napping for 10 minutes or so every 3\u20134 hours during the day. Her nighttime sleep seemed entirely normal to her, but Eric reflected that she sometimes jerked or moved around a good deal in her sleep. It was the falling attacks that had prompted this evaluation. At first Emma noticed only a sort of weakness in her neck muscles when she felt sleepy. Over the course of a year the weakness had increased, until now it affected every voluntary muscle in her body. It could happen at any time, but usually it was associated with the onset of sud - den sleepiness. At these times she seemed to lose all of her strength, sometimes so sud- denly that she didn\u2019t even have time to sit down. Then she would collapse, right where she had been standing, though she would often retain full consciousness. Today it had happened while she was sitting down. Once it had happened while she was trying to park her car. She had seen a neurologist the month before, but an EEG had revealed no evidence of a seizure disorder, and an MRI was normal.

Some patients have vivid dreams that occur during the onset of sleep, and sleep paralysis, which also occurs unnoticed during normal REM sleep. Sleep apnea also causes daytime sleepiness, but it usually occurs in male patients who are middle-aged or older. Differential diagnosis should also include all the other possible causes of excessive somnolence: substance- induced sleep disorders; major depressive episode with atypical features ; various cognitive disorders (especially delirium); and a panoply of medical illnesses, such as hypothyroidism, epilepsy, hypo- glycemia, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, and rarer neurological conditions such as Kleine\u2013Levin and Prader\u2013Willi syndromes. Emma\u2019s clinician should, of course, consider each of these. Don\u2019t disregard plain vanilla insufficient sleep and circadian rhythm sleep\u2013wake disorder, delayed sleep phase type\u2014both staples of adolescence. Although Emma\u2019s clinical symptoms fulfill the DSM-5 requirements for narco - lepsy, for us to determine the coding type, she would have to submit to a lumbar punc- ture for a measurement of cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin. I\u2019m not sure that she (or many other patients) would willingly submit to the procedure for such limited benefit. Nar - colepsy with cataplexy is almost always associated with reduced hypocretin, so, with a GAF score of 60, her diagnosis would almost certainly turn out to be this: G47.8 [780.59] Narcolepsy with cataplexy with unknown hypocretin status DSM-5 notes that laboratory validators have become increasingly used in evaluating and diagnosing the sleep disorders, to the extent that they are now required for some condi- tions. One of these, the multiple sleep latency test , is an evaluation done by polysomnog - raphy in a sleep laboratory.

    "required for some condi- tions. One of these, the multiple sleep latency test , is an evaluation done by polysomnog - raphy in a sleep laboratory. First described by Dement and c arskadon in 1977, it is the standard by which we are now advised to judge hypersomnolence. Here\u2019s how it works: During the patient\u2019s normal waking time, in a quiet, darkened room, an EEG is recorded during naps. after 20 minutes, the patient is awakened, then asked to nap again 2 hours later. This is repeated every 2 hours for a total of four or five sessions. Each epi- sode of sleep is interrupted as soon as REM is detected, so as to preserve REM pressure for subsequent episodes. The times until the patient falls asleep (sleep latency) are aver - aged, yielding the score used for diagnosis. a score of 5 minutes is generally considered significant for the diagnosis of narcolepsy, though times tend to increase somewhat with age. The multiple sleep latency test is not specific for narcolepsy: Positive scores are found in some people with sleep apnea or sleep deprivation, and even in a few (2\u20134%) people who have no symptoms at all. Narcolepsy 317 Breathing- related Sleep Disorders G47.33 [327.23] Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Central Sleep Apnea Apnea is easy: It means simply the absence of breathing. Hypopnea \u2014shallow or infre - quent breathing\u2014has been variously defined. by convention, it now refers to a period of at least 10 seconds during which air flow is reduced by 30% or more and oxygen saturation of the blood is reduced by at least 4%. as you have probably guessed, there is also a mixed form. It begins with a central apnea and ends in an obstructive apnea. Here are two sleep\u2013wake disorders that can kill. For periods lasting 10 seconds to a minute or longer during sleep (never while a patient is awake), airflow through the upper respiratory passages of these patients stops completely. Gas exchange falls off, affording sufferers a little taste of suffocation every time they go to bed. In the more common obstructive type, the chest heaves as the sleeper tries to inhale, but tissues in the mouth and pharynx prevent the normal flow of air. The strug- gle can rage for up to 2 minutes, culminating in an extraordinarily loud snore. All of this may be inapparent to the patient, but a bed",
    "the chest heaves as the sleeper tries to inhale, but tissues in the mouth and pharynx prevent the normal flow of air. The strug- gle can rage for up to 2 minutes, culminating in an extraordinarily loud snore. All of this may be inapparent to the patient, but a bed partner is usually well aware. Most patients experience far more than 30 of these episodes per night. In the less common central type (which comprises a number of possible etiolo - gies), the patient simply stops making any effort to breathe\u2014the diaphragm just takes a rest, so to speak. Snoring can be present, but it is usually not prominent. Affected men may complain especially of hypersomnolence, women of insomnia. Note that patients don\u2019t need to have symptoms to qualify for this diagnosis; polysomnographic findings alone will be enough. However, patients typically note that they awaken at night, short of breath, and consequently feel sleepy the next day. This condition is found with the chronic use of opioids or with severe neurological or medical illnesses\u2014 disorders you are unlikely to encounter outside a critical care ward. (Cheyne\u2013 Stokes breathing is found in people who have had recent stroke and heart failure.) Regardless of type, the blood of a patient with sleep apnea becomes depleted of oxygen until breathing starts again. Often patients are not aware of these events at all, though some may awaken partly or completely. Besides snoring and daytime drowsi - ness, there are often problems with hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias; patients may also complain of morning headaches and impotence. During the night, some peo- ple become markedly restless, kicking at bedclothes (or bed partners), standing up, or even walking. Other sequelae include irritability and cognitive impairment, as shown by distractibility, problems with perception or memory, or bewilderment. Patients may 318 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS also experience heavy sweating, hallucinations when going to sleep, sleep talking, or sleep terrors. Nocturia (getting up at night to urinate) is often associated with sleep apnea, though no one knows why. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea affects perhaps 5% of the general population, increasing with age to about 20% at 65. Besides old age, risk factors include obesity (shirt collar size over 16\u00bd for adult men), African American ethnicity, and (the mutu - ally exclusive) male gender and pregnancy.

    "age to about 20% at 65.

It is highly familial, with a genetic basis. Enlarged tonsil tissue can put even young children at risk. Because sleep apnea is potentially lethal, always consider it in the differential diagnosis of either hypersomnolence or insomnia. Rapid detection and management can be life- saving. Although an observant bed partner can provide evidence of sleep apnea that is almost definitive, confirmatory polysomnography is now required for diagnosis. The symptoms are similar for the two types, and discrimination depends on spe - cific polysomnography findings, so I\u2019ve provided only one vignette. The criteria make central sleep apnea one of the few DSM diagnoses that you can\u2019t sub - stantiate on purely clinical grounds. In fact, no clinical features at all are described. Though mental retardation, now intellectual disability, previously involved an I q test, even that requirement (for severity levels) has been dumped by DSM-5. Still, with the sleep disorder requirements, I worry that we may be witnessing the beginnings of change to a world where mental health diagnosis is no longer a clinical discipline, but one that makes its home in the laboratory. Essential Features of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea A patient complains of daytime sleepiness that results from nighttime breathing problems: (often long) pauses in breathing, followed by loud snores or snorts. Poly- somnography reveals obstructive apneas and hypopneas. The Fine Print Diagnosis requires at least 5 apneas or hypopneas per hour, unless the history reveals no nocturnal breathing symptoms or daytime sleepiness; then, there must be 15 apnea/hypopnea episodes per hour. The D\u2019s: There are none. Sleep Apnea 319 Coding Notes Code severity, based on number of apneas/hypopneas per hour: Mild. Fewer than 15. Moderate. 15\u201330. Severe. 30+.

She meant her hus - band\u2019s snoring. \u201cI used to sleep soundly myself, so it didn\u2019t bother me. Lately, I\u2019ve had arthritis that\u2019s kept me awake. Roy rattles the windows.\u201d Lying awake nights waiting for the painkiller to take effect, Lily had opportunities for minutely studying her husband\u2019s sleeping habits. As someone who slept on his back, Roy had always been a noisy breather at night. But every 5 minutes or so, his respira - tions dropped off to nothing. After 20 or 30 seconds, during which his chest would pitch and heave, he\u2019d finally break through with an enormous snort. This would be rapidly followed by several additional louder-than-usual snores. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder the neighbors don\u2019t complain,\u201d Lily said. Roy Dardis was a tall man of enormous bulk\u2014a testament to Lily\u2019s country cook - ing. He guessed he\u2019d always snored some; his brother, with whom he had shared a room as a child, used to tease him about it. Of course, as he jokingly pointed out, the racket 320 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS never bothered him because he slept right through it. Roy\u2019s complaint was that he just didn\u2019t feel rested. He tended to nod off, whether he was at work or watching TV, which left him grumpy. In the mornings, Roy often awakened with a headache that seemed localized to the front of his head. Two cups of strong coffee usually took care of the headache. Evaluation of Roy Dardis Lily Dardis presented strong evidence that Roy had sleep apnea: She observed that Roy had many periods when he would stop breathing, then resume with an extra-loud snore. From her description of his struggles to breathe during the apneic periods, this would appear to be an obstructive type of sleep apnea. Roy\u2019s bulk, morning headaches, and complaints about dropping off to sleep during the day are also typical of sleep apnea. A clinician should ask any patient like Roy about hallucinations when going to sleep, changes in personality (irritability, aggression, anxiety,",
    "would appear to be an obstructive type of sleep apnea. Roy\u2019s bulk, morning headaches, and complaints about dropping off to sleep during the day are also typical of sleep apnea. A clinician should ask any patient like Roy about hallucinations when going to sleep, changes in personality (irritability, aggression, anxiety, depression), loss of sex interest, impotence, night terrors, and sleepwalking; each of these is encountered with varying frequency in sleep apnea. Patients also often have heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and alcohol use, though some of these are undoubtedly complications rather than causes. Other causes of hypersomnolence should be considered, though they would not seem likely in Roy\u2019s case. Daytime sleepiness and hypnagogic hallucinations occur in narcolepsy, but Roy had no cataplexy and his daytime naps were not refreshing. Of course, many otherwise normal people snore, and this should be considered in the dif- ferential diagnosis of any patient whose chief complaint is snoring. Despite Roy\u2019s typical history, sleep lab studies must be pursued; in addition to the diagnostic requirement for polysomnography, his blood oxygen saturation dur - ing an attack of apnea should be evaluated. Other mental disorders (especially mood and anxiety disorders) and substance- related disorders should be evaluated. Some of these\u2014 notably major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and major neurocognitive disorder\u2014may be found as associated diagnoses. Roy had a GAF score of 60. We\u2019re supposed to score severity based on polysom - nography. But on clinical grounds I would judge that Roy was at least moderately impaired by his disorder, and that\u2019s the level I\u2019d put down\u2014at least until he received some testing: G47.33 [327.23] Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, moderate E66.9 [278.00] Obesity Sleep- Related Hypoventilation Health and comfort demand steady regulation of our blood gases: oxygen (O 2) high, which means 95% or higher; carbon dioxide (CO 2) just right\u2014not too high, not too low\u2014in the range of 23\u201329 milliequivalents per liter. Our bodies accomplish this by Sleep- related Hypoventilation 321 means of a simple feedback loop: Low O 2 or high CO 2 signals the brain\u2019s respiratory center that our lungs need to work harder. In people with sleep- related hypoventila- tion, however, the chemoreceptors and the medullary (brainstem) neuronal network fail to send the right sort of signal, so breathing remains shallow.

    "harder. In people with sleep- related hypoventila- tion, however, the chemoreceptors and the medullary (brainstem) neuronal network fail to send the right sort of signal, so breathing remains shallow. When awake, these folks can compensate by intentionally breathing faster or deeper, but during sleep, that strategy fails and breathing becomes shallower still. Symptoms are usually worse dur - ing sleep, and periods of apnea, when breathing stops completely, usually occur. This condition is found especially in people who are severely overweight or who have disorders such as muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and tumors or other lesions of the spinal cord or central nervous system. Most adult patients (usually men ages 20\u201350) don\u2019t complain of breathing problems, but they do report the insidious development of daytime drowsiness, fatigue, morning headache, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and unrefreshing sleep. They may also have ankle edema and the blue skin tone that indicates oxygen deficit. Even small doses of seda - tives or narcotics can make already inadequate breathing much worse. Tragically, it can affect small children, too (see the next sidebar). Despite the many clues such as daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and morning head - ache, the DSM-5 criteria set rests entirely on results of polysomnography. The syn - drome is uncommon, so I\u2019ve provided no vignette.

When she finds him snoring in the arms of another woman, she reminds him that he had sworn \u201cfaithfulness with every waking breath.\u201d She then utters the curse that he will keep breathing only so long as he remains awake. When he inevitably falls asleep, he dies. We aren\u2019t told how the curse of a now mortal Ondine could retain its force, and it remains unexplained why the term is usually attached specifically to the congenital form of hypoventilation. but in roughly 1 of 50,000 live births\u2014 traceable to a sporadic mutation in PHO x2b, an autosomal dominant gene on chromosome 4\u2014the child simply doesn\u2019t breathe when sleeping. These children usually die young, though recently, with trache - ostomy and nighttime mechanically assisted breathing, some have survived to relatively normal adulthood. Circadian rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorders The word circadian comes from the Latin meaning \u201cabout 1 day.\u201d It refers to the body\u2019s cycles of sleep, temperature, and hormone production, which are generated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain\u2019s anterior hypothalamus. When there are no external time cues (natural daylight or artificial reminders like clocks), the free- running human cycle is actually about 24 hours, 9 minutes\u2014a discrepancy too small to cause most of us any serious difficulty. But sometimes a misalignment between our natural body rhythms and the demands of our work or social lives results in unwanted sleep - lessness or drowsiness, or both. The normal circadian sleep\u2013wake cycle changes throughout life. It lengthens dur- ing adolescence; that\u2019s one reason why teenagers are prone to late nights and sleeping in. It shortens again in old age, causing older people to fall asleep in the evening while reading or watching television, and making both shift work and jet lag harder on them. Whatever happened to jet lag? In DSM-IV, it was one of the possible circadian rhythm subtypes. but because it is so common, brief, and (really, when you think about it) pretty darned normal to our jet- setting sensibilities, it has been removed from the pantheon of DSM disorders. Still, it might be useful to mention its symptoms. you\u2019ve probably had it yourself. after air travel across several time zones, you expe - rienced attacks of intense sleepiness and fatigue.

    "been removed from the pantheon of DSM disorders. Still, it might be useful to mention its symptoms. you\u2019ve probably had it yourself. after air travel across several time zones, you expe - rienced attacks of intense sleepiness and fatigue. Perhaps, like some people, you felt nauseated or had other flu-like symptoms. b ut by the second day you began adjusting to the new time zone, and within a few days you felt just fine. Most people find that time adjustment is faster and easier after flying westward than the reverse. Perhaps this is because the body\u2019s natural cycle is a little longer than 24 hours; perhaps it is because we can keep ourselves awake on the long trip home from Circadian rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorders 323 Europe, then crash for a truly splendid night\u2019s sleep. Studies have shown that adjustment to westward flights occurs at the rate of about 90 minutes per day, whereas adjustment to eastward flights is only about 1 hour per day. This is true regardless of which direction you fly when leaving home. Well, except north or south. So, if (when) jet lag visits you, cope with it as you would with any other normal feature of contemporary life. you are in the remarkable situation of feeling ill without being sick. Circadian Rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorder, Delayed Sleep Phase Type Because they feel alert and active in the late evening, people with delayed sleep phase\u2014 variously called \u201cowls\u201d or \u201cnight people\u201d\u2014go to sleep late (sometimes progres- sively later each night) and awaken in late morning or afternoon. Left to their own devices, they feel just fine. But if they must arise early to attend class or get to work (or eat lunch), they feel drowsy and may even appear \u201csleep-drunk.\u201d Irregular sleep habits and the use of caffeine or other stimulants only worsen their plight. Such people may account for up to 10% of sleep clinic patients who complain of chronic insomnia. The delayed sleep phase type is by far the most common type; it is especially common among teens and young adults. Delayed sleep phase is even esti - mated (telephone survey) to occur in about 3% of the older (ages 40\u201364) general popula- tion. A familial component can be identified in up to 40%. Note that delayed sleep phase must be distinguished from the lifestyle issues of those who simply prefer going to bed late and",
    "esti - mated (telephone survey) to occur in about 3% of the older (ages 40\u201364) general popula- tion. A familial component can be identified in up to 40%. Note that delayed sleep phase must be distinguished from the lifestyle issues of those who simply prefer going to bed late and sleeping in. Those people may feel quite comfortable with their eccentric schedules, which they don\u2019t make much effort to alter. People with the actual disorder complain of hypersomnolence and would like to change. Circadian Rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorder, Advanced Sleep Phase Type Patients with advanced sleep phase are the opposite of those just described; we might call this the \u201cearly to bed, early to rise\u201d disorder. Their desired time to sleep is early rather than late, so they feel great in the morning but are sleepy in the late afternoon or early evening. Sometimes they\u2019re called \u201clarks.\u201d Advanced sleep phase appears to be much less frequent even than delayed sleep phase, though this could be in part because it causes less discomfort and fewer social problems. It has been reported to occur more often with advancing age and to run in families. Circadian Rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorder, Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type The non-24-hour type is also called the free- running type, and it occurs mainly in completely blind people, who of course have no light cues to entrain their biological 324 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS clocks. (Up to 50% of blind people may be affected, beginning at the age total blind - ness begins; most of those with minimal light perception\u2014even the equivalent of a single candle\u2014remain normally entrained.) Sighted people who are affected tend to be mainly young (teens and 20s) and male; they often have other mental disorders. The 18-hour schedules that accompany life in a submarine can also lead to a free- running biological rhythm. Most sighted people who undergo a research protocol in which there are no visual time cues will ultimately develop non-24-hour sleep\u2013wake type. Circadian Rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorder, Irregular Sleep\u2013Wake Type The pattern here is . . . no pattern. The patients\u2019 total sleep duration may be normal, but they feel sleepy or insomniac at varying, and unpredictable, times of day. They may take naps, so it\u2019s important to rule out poor sleep hygiene. Irregular type may be encountered in various neurological conditions, including dementia, intellectual disability, and traumatic brain injury. The prevalence is unknown, but it\u2019s probably",

Irregular type may be encountered in various neurological conditions, including dementia, intellectual disability, and traumatic brain injury. The prevalence is unknown, but it\u2019s probably rare. As far as we know, this condition affects the sexes about equally. Age is a risk factor, mainly due to the late-life presence of medical disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Circadian Rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorder, Shift Work Type When workers must change from one shift to another, especially when they must be active during their former sleep time, sleepiness sets in and performance declines. Sleep during the new sleep time is often disrupted and too brief. The symptoms, which can affect nearly a third of people doing shift work, are worst after a switch to night work, though people vary considerably in the time required for this adjustment. Addi- tional factors include age, commuting distance, and whether the individual is naturally a \u201clark\u201d or an \u201cowl.\u201d Symptoms may last 3 weeks or longer, especially if workers try to resume their normal sleeping schedules on weekends or holidays. Essential Features of Circadian rhythm Sleep\u2013Wake Disorders A recurring mismatch between the patient\u2019s sleep\u2013wake pattern and environmental demands causes insomnia or hypersomnolence.

Marcelle Klinger Marcelle was a 60-year-old registered nurse, one of seven employed by her small com- munity hospital in the northern California hills. The entire facility had only 32 beds, and although there were nursing aides and licensed practical nurses to assist, state law required a registered nurse always to be present in the facility. When the nurse who had worked the graveyard shift (11 P.M. to 7:30 a.m.) finally retired, the hospital admin- istrator asked for a volunteer to fill that position. \u201cNobody did,\u201d said Marcelle, \u201cso some genius decided it was only fair that every - one take turns.\u201d The result was 4-week shifts. In the course of a year, each nurse would work six of these shifts on days, four on evenings, and two on graveyard. Everyone grumbled, but Marcelle hated it the most. The switch from days to evenings wasn\u2019t too bad; she lived close by, so she could be home in bed by midnight. But the graveyard shift was a disaster. 326 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS \u201cI\u2019m the only registered nurse there, and I\u2019m supposed to be awake and alert the whole time. Patients depend on me. But my eyes keep squeezing themselves shut, and my brain seems to hum, as if it\u2019s going to sleep. Part of the time I feel sick to my stom- ach. One time I did fall asleep at work, just for 10 minutes or so. When the phone rang, I woke up feeling hung over.\u201d Marcelle\u2019s physical and mental health was excellent. She\u2019d always been a light sleeper, so she found daytime sleeping nearly impossible. Heavy drapes could keep out most of the light, but traffic noise and the sounds from passersby on the sidewalk outside her bedroom frequently awakened her. Moreover, the coffee Marcelle drank to keep awake at work prevented her from going to sleep as soon as she went to bed. It also got her up to the bathroom at least once or twice.

    "outside her bedroom frequently awakened her. Moreover, the coffee Marcelle drank to keep awake at work prevented her from going to sleep as soon as she went to bed. It also got her up to the bathroom at least once or twice. By the time her husband came home in the afternoon from teaching school, she had seldom slept more than 3 or 4 hours. On weekends, she tried to resume a nor- mal schedule so that she could be with her family, but that only made things worse. \u201cI flew to Paris once and felt jet- lagged for a week. Now I\u2019m sick that way for a whole month.\u201d Evaluation of Marcelle Klinger Several features of Marcelle\u2019s condition could have contributed to her discomfort: 1. Like many people who must work shifts (criterion A), she tried to re-readjust her sleep\u2013wake schedule on the weekends. 2. Cues from outside her window served to arouse her when she tried to sleep. 3. She was 60; because of the physiology of their sleep, older people often have trouble making these adjustments. 4. She drank coffee to stay awake; the dual effects of the caffeine- induced stimu- lation and her need to get up to urinate interfered further with what sleep she could get. As a consequence, she suffered both from insomnia and hypersom- nolence (B), with obvious attendant distress (C). From her history, we learn that Marcelle had no physical illness , substance use, or other mental disorder. (Although patients with a psychosis such as schizophrenia are sometimes kept up progressively later at night by their hallucinations, mood and anxiety disorders generally produce only insomnia or hypersomnolence.) The vignette provides no evidence for any other sleep\u2013wake disorder: When Marcelle napped, it was not refreshing (this would argue against narcolepsy ). She had always been a light sleeper anyway, but light sleep per se is not considered a sleep disorder (except by some light sleepers). The subtype is obvious; Marcelle\u2019s GAF score would be 65.

As he explained to the sleep specialist, \u201cIt\u2019s partly because I knew I\u2019d be at my worst. I thought you might get a better picture of what I\u2019m up against.\u201d He rubbed his eyes, which were rimmed with dark circles. \u201cI know, I look like a Doonesbury cartoon character.\u201d Fenton\u2019s trouble had begun as long ago as high school. \u201cI\u2019d never have made those 8 o\u2019clock classes if my mom hadn\u2019t been there for me.\u201d He rubbed his eyes again and yawned. \u201cWell, at me. Couple of times, she dumped a pan of cold water on me. It did get me out of bed.\u201d In college, Fenton had never scheduled a class before noon, when he could man - age. That worked out pretty well because he was living with his father, who had kept the same schedule for 35 years as night shift manager at a convenience store. That was how he avoided the hung-over feeling of waking too early. \u201cI saw him once when he got off an early plane. He was asleep on his feet. His dad was first- generation Ameri- can, and the family still speaks a little German. He called it Schlaftrunkenheit \u2014sleep drunkenness.\u201d \u201c \u2018Early to bed, early to rise\u2019 must have been written by a sadist,\u201d Fenton com - mented. Several times over the years, he\u2019d tried changing his own sleep schedule by going to bed earlier. After a few days, he\u2019d always given it up. \u201cLifelong, if I hit the sack before 2 a.m., I just lie there, pissed off.\u201d For a couple of years, Fenton had worked the swing shift for an electronics parts fabricator. \u201cThat strategy worked perfectly for me. When I got off at 11:30 at night, I could spend whatever time I needed at home, decompressing. I could go to bed when I wanted, and I only had to get up in time to start my shift at 4. That\u2019s p.m.\u201d \u201cSo what is the problem now?\u201d the clinician wanted to know. Now Fenton had begun working at the pancake house run by the father of his fian- c\u00e9e, Jaylene. \u201cDo you know what time people eat pancakes?\u201d he asked. He and Jaylene both get up early to open up shop. \u201cIt works fine for her; she\u2019s a lark.",

But at 5 a.m., this owl doesn\u2019t give a hoot.\u201d Evaluation of Fenton Schmidt Fenton\u2019s problem is instantly apparent: His sleeping requirements just didn\u2019t jibe with those of his job and his social and personal life (criterion A). With no physical illness (such as traumatic brain injury) or substance use problems that would provide an alter- native explanation, the resulting hypersomnolence (B) and distress (C) would complete the criteria for a circadian rhythm sleep\u2013wake disorder. Of course, his clinician should 328 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS carefully rule out poor sleep hygiene. The fact that he was genuinely troubled suggests that it was not simply a lifestyle issue. Fenton\u2019s history provides ample evidence that, of the possible subtypes, his would be delayed sleep phase type. There was really no need for further verification by poly- somnography. His GAF score would be 62.

Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders Although awakening to the jangle of a telephone in the dead of night can be a struggle, mostly it\u2019s a pretty straight shot from sleeping to fully awake. OK, we don\u2019t like it, feel unwell, curse the caller, and turn over to shut out the sound of the ring\u2014but we\u2019re awake, all right, and we know it. For reasons largely unclear, however, it doesn\u2019t always work that way. For some people, a way station between being asleep and being awake causes reactions that range from bemusement to frank horror. It all stems from the three possible states of the relationship of body and mind. During wakefulness, they both are working; in non-REM (deep) sleep, both are more or less idling. During REM (dreaming) sleep, though, the mind is at work but the body rests; in fact, our voluntary muscles are paralyzed, so that we cannot move.

    "wakefulness, they both are working; in non-REM (deep) sleep, both are more or less idling. During REM (dreaming) sleep, though, the mind is at work but the body rests; in fact, our voluntary muscles are paralyzed, so that we cannot move. (The fourth conceivable combination, active body with sleeping mind, is the stuff of zombie films.) During non-REM sleep arousal disorders, patients experience simultaneous sleeping and waking EEG patterns; symptoms ensue. Partial arousals that occur suddenly from non-REM sleep usually occur in the first hour or two of sleep, when slow-wave sleep is most prevalent. Though the behaviors sometimes overlap, there are three main types of abnormal arousal. I\u2019ve listed them in order of increasing severity: Confusional arousal < Sleepwalking < Sleep terror In each of these, events tend to be poorly recalled. Each is more common in children, in whom they are considered generally benign, perhaps caused by a relatively immature nervous system. One of them, confusional arousal, didn\u2019t quite make it into the official DSM-5 pantheon (see sidebar, p. 335). Non-rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders 329 Some episodes occur spontaneously, but others follow apparent precipitants, which can include stress, irregular sleep, drugs, and sleep deprivation. Although family his - tory is often positive, a genetic causation hasn\u2019t been nailed down. Essential Features of Non-rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders The patient repeatedly awakens incompletely from sleep with sleepwalking or sleep terror (see Coding Notes). The attempts of others to communicate or console don\u2019t help much. The patient has little if any dream imagery at the time and tends not to remember the episode the next morning.

    "Beginning with a scream of panic, the patient abruptly arouses from sleep and shows intense fear and signs of autonomic arousal, such as dilated pupils, rapid breathing, rapid heartbeat, and sweat- ing. Sleep paralysis isn\u2019t a disorder; it\u2019s a normal feature of sleep. b ut it can be frightening when it occurs right at the start (or conclusion) of sleep, when you\u2019re partly conscious. Lasting from mere seconds to several minutes, episodes may be accompanied by appari- tions of being approached by some sort of \u201ccreature\u201d that soon vanishes. Sleep paralysis when partly awake happens in around 8% of young adults. Its frequency is increased by all the usual suspects: sleep deprivation, stress, and keeping irregular hours (such as with shift work). Treatment, other than reassurance, is usually unnecessary. 330 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorder, Sleepwalking Type Sleepwalking behavior tends to follow a fairly set pattern; it usually occurs during the first third of the night, when non-REM sleep is more prevalent. Sleepwalkers first sit up and make some sort of recurring movement (such as plucking at the bedclothes). More purposeful behavior may follow, perhaps dressing, eating, or using the toilet. The person\u2019s facial expression is usually blank and staring. If these individuals talk at all, it is usually garbled; speaking sentences is rare. Their movements tend to be poorly coor- dinated, sometimes resulting in considerable danger. Amnesia for the episode is usual, though this is variable. Individual episodes last anywhere from a few seconds to 30 minutes, during which a person will often be hard to awaken, though spontaneous awakening may occur\u2014 usually to a brief period of disorientation. Some individuals simply return to bed with- out awakening. Occasionally a person who goes to sleep in one location will express surprise upon awakening elsewhere. DSM-5 lists two subtypes of sleepwalking: with sleep- related eating, and with sleep- related sexual behavior (sexsomnia\u2014yes, even DSM-5 actually calls it that). The former occurs mainly in women, and it\u2019s not the same as night eating syndrome, wherein the person is awake and remembers the next day. The latter, which includes masturbation and sometimes sexual behavior with other people, is more common in men and can have legal repercussions. Sleepwalking may occur nightly, though the frequency is usually less. As with nightmares and sleep terrors, don\u2019t diagnose sleepwalking type unless the episodes are recurrent and cause impairment or distress. And,",

Sleepwalking may occur nightly, though the frequency is usually less. As with nightmares and sleep terrors, don\u2019t diagnose sleepwalking type unless the episodes are recurrent and cause impairment or distress. And, as with so many other sleep disorders, sleepwalking episodes are more likely when a person is tired or has been under stress. In adults, the condition appears to have familial and genetic components. Perhaps 6% of all children sleepwalk; in them, it isn\u2019t considered pathological. It usually begins between the ages of 6 and 12 and lasts for several years, with most outgrowing it by age 15. Maybe 20% continue to sleepwalk into their adult lives; sleep- walking affects up to 4% of adult men and women, with a typical age of onset between 10 and 15. Then it tends to be chronic until the fourth decade of life. Although adults with sleepwalking type may have a personality disorder, sleepwalking in children has no prognostic significance. Ross Josephson \u201cI brought along a video. I thought it might help to explain my problem.\u201d Ross Joseph- son handed a thumb drive to the clinician. Ross lived in a dormitory with two room - mates, who had provided the video. Ross walked in his sleep. He supposed it had started when he was quite young, though he hadn\u2019t fully realized it until one hot July dawn when he was 12 and had awakened in his pajamas, curled up on the porch swing. When he told his mother, she remarked that she and her two brothers had all walked in their sleep when they were young. She guessed that Ross would grow out of it, too. Non-rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders 331 Only he hadn\u2019t. A freshman in college now, Ross pursued his nocturnal strolls once or twice a month. At first his roommates had been amused; the video had been a hit at an impromptu party they had gotten up with some of the girls who lived downstairs. They had lain awake several nights until they caught the complete sequence. Ross had taken the joke well. In fact, he had been fascinated to see how he appeared when sleep- walking.

    "several nights until they caught the complete sequence. Ross had taken the joke well. In fact, he had been fascinated to see how he appeared when sleep- walking. But last week his roommates had become alarmed when they caught him stepping through an open window onto the third-floor roof of their building. Other than a low rim around the edge, there was nothing to prevent a nasty 30-foot fall into the grape ivy below. Although they had pulled him back inside, it had not been without a struggle; clearly, the sleeping Ross had resisted guidance. After an interview and physical exam by one of the consultants in the student health service, Ross had been pronounced healthy and referred to the campus mental health clinic. The clinician and Ross watched the video together. The image was grainy and danced around a good deal, as if the cameraperson was trying to contain laughter. It showed a pajama-clad Ross sitting up in bed. Although his eyes were open, they didn\u2019t appear to be focused on anything, and his face registered no emotion. At first he only pulled\u2014 aimlessly, it seemed\u2014at the sheet and blanket. Suddenly he swung his feet to the floor and stood up. He slipped off his pajama top and let it fall onto the bed. Then he walked out through the door into the hallway. For 2 or 3 minutes, the camera followed Ross. He walked up and down the hall several times and finally disappeared into the bathroom, where the camera did not pur- sue. When he emerged, another young man (\u201cThat\u2019s Ted, one of my roommates,\u201d Ross explained) appeared on screen and tried to engage him in conversation. Ross responded with a few syllables, none of which was a recognizable word. Finally, he allowed Ted to guide him gently back to his bed. Almost as soon as he lay down, he appeared to be asleep. The entire video lasted perhaps 10 minutes. \u201cWhen they showed me this the next morning, I was amazed. I hadn\u2019t the slightest idea I\u2019d done anything but sleep that night. I never do.\u201d Evaluation of Ross Josephson Although sleepwalking is not considered pathological in children, adults with the sleepwalking type of non-REM sleep arousal disorder may have a personality disorder or other psychopathology.

    "Evaluation of Ross Josephson Although sleepwalking is not considered pathological in children, adults with the sleepwalking type of non-REM sleep arousal disorder may have a personality disorder or other psychopathology. They should be carefully investigated with a full interview (as should just about everyone who consults a mental health care provider). However, occasional sleepwalking is likely to be more annoying than pathological. Let\u2019s quickly review Ross\u2019s relation to the criteria for non-REM sleep arousal dis- order. His awakenings were incomplete (almost nonexistent, actually) and recurrent (criterion A1), during which he did sleepwalk, gazing with unseeing eyes.

The vignette doesn\u2019t specify whether Ross had dream imagery (it should have; criterion B), but it does note that he never had any memory of the episodes the following day (C). Although Ross was himself not distressed, his roommates were: They didn\u2019t want to officiate as Ross plunged from a rooftop (D). The differential diagnosis also includes psychomotor epilepsy , which can begin during sleep and present with sleepwalking. The dissociative condition known as the fugue subtype of dissociative amnesia may sometimes be confused with sleepwalk - ing, but fugues last longer and involve complex behaviors, such as speaking complete sentences. Nighttime wandering can be found in sleep apnea. Ross had no evidence for substance use (F). Other nighttime disturbances and sleep disorders can be associated with sleep - walking; these include nocturnal enuresis , nightmare disorder, and the sleep terror type of non-REM sleep arousal disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder , posttrau- matic stress disorder , and mood disorders can also occur. However, none of these conditions is suggested in the vignette (F). Ross would have a GAF score of 75; his diagnosis would be as follows: F51.3 [307.46] Non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder, sleepwalking type In the hundreds of years that sleepwalking has been recognized, it has amassed an exten- sive, if inaccurate, mythology. also known as somnambulism (which means\u2014 surprise!\u2014 \u201csleepwalking\u201d), it has been a reliable device for playwrights (paging Mr. Shakespeare) and innumerable authors of mystery thrillers.

One popular myth is that it is dangerous to awaken a sleepwalker. Perhaps this grew out of the observation that it is difficult to do so; in any event, I know of no evidence to support this belief. Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorder, Sleep Terror Type Sleep terrors (also known as night terrors or pavor nocturnus) usually affect children, with a typical onset during ages 4\u201312. When they begin in adulthood, it is usually in the 20s or 30s\u2014hardly ever after the age of 40. As is true of nightmares versus nightmare disorder (see p. 340), only events that are recurrent and produce distress or impairment qualify for a diagnosis of the sleep terror type of non-REM sleep arousal disorder. A sleep terror attack begins with a loud cry or scream during a period of non- REM sleep, not long after the patient goes to bed. The person sits up, appears terrified, and seems to be awake but does not respond to attempts at soothing. There will be signs of sympathetic nervous system arousal, such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, and piloerection (hairs standing up on the skin). With deep breathing and dilated pupils, the person seems ready for fight or flight, aroused but not arousable. An attack usually lasts 5\u201315 minutes and terminates spontaneously with return to sleep. Most patients Non-rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders 333 have no memory of the incident the following morning, though some adults may have fragmentary recall. There is usually an interval of days to weeks between sleep terror attacks, though stress and fatigue may increase the frequency. In adults, the disorder is equally com - mon in males and females. With a peak at age 6, prevalence is around 3% in children\u2014less than that for adults, but frequent enough not to be considered rare. In children, sleep terrors are not considered pathological. They almost invariably grow out of them and suffer no medi - cal or psychological pathology later in life. The adult-onset type may be associated with some other mental condition such as an anxiety or personality disorder.

Bud Stanhope Bud Stanhope and his wife, Harriette, had just begun marital counseling. They agreed on exactly one thing, which was that many of their problems could be traced to Bud\u2019s excessive need for support. They had married when each was on the rebound, soon after Bud\u2019s first wife divorced him. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable being alone,\u201d said Bud. His chronically low self- esteem meant that Bud couldn\u2019t so much as start a building project around the house without consulting Harriette. Once, when Harriette was out of town at a convention, he even called up his ex-wife for advice. And because he was afraid to disagree with Harriette, they never got anything resolved. \u201cI don\u2019t even feel I can tell him how much it bugs me when he wakes me up with those night frights,\u201d she said. \u201cNight frights?\u201d said Bud. \u201cI thought those stopped months ago.\u201d As Harriette described them, Bud\u2019s \u201cfrights\u201d were always the same. An hour or so after they went to sleep, she\u2019d awaken to his blood- curdling scream. Bud would be sit- ting bolt upright in bed, a look of stark terror on his face. His eyes wide open, he would be staring off into a corner or toward a wall. She was never sure if he was seeing some- thing, because he never said much that was intelligible\u2014only babble or the occasional random word. He would seem agitated, pluck at his bedclothes, and sometimes start to get out of bed. \u201cThe hairs on his arms will be standing straight up. He\u2019s usually breathing fast and perspiring, even if it\u2019s cold in the room. Once when I put my hand on his chest, his heart seemed to be beating as fast as a rabbit\u2019s.\u201d It would take Harriette 10 or 15 minutes to soothe Bud. He never fully awakened, but would eventually lie down. Then he would almost instantly fall fast asleep again, while she sometimes lay awake for hours. Bud would have one of these attacks every 2 or 3 weeks. Only once did it happen two nights running, and that was during one par - ticularly bad period when he felt sure he was about to lose his job.

Evaluation of Bud Stanhope Several features of Bud\u2019s attacks are distinctive for sleep terrors: the evidence of auto - nomic arousal (rapid heartbeat, sweating), occurrence soon after falling asleep, Har - 334 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS riette\u2019s inability to console him, his lack of full awakening, and his lack of recall the next day. Taken as a whole, this story is virtually diagnostic, but I\u2019ll list the important elements anyway. Bud\u2019s episodes of arousal were both incomplete and recurrent (cri - terion A). Harriet reported marked difficulty soothing him (A2). If he ever had dream imagery, he did not report it (B), and he had no recall (he was surprised he was still having the terror episodes; C). Without argument (certainly not from Bud or Harriet), they were distressing at the time (D). We\u2019d have to enquire further to make sure that substance misuse played no role in his history (E). As an exercise, note how each of these features helps to differentiate this disorder from nightmare disorder. Although this did not happen to Bud, sleepwalking (sometimes sleep running) occurs in many patients with sleep terrors. In adults, you may have to distinguish sleep terrors from psychomotor epilepsy, which can also produce sleepwalking. Panic attacks sometimes occur at night, but these patients awaken completely, without the disorientation and disorganized behavior of typical sleep terrors. Bud also had significant personality problems. As noted in the vignette, he required a great deal of consultation and support (he even leaned on his ex-wife for advice when Harriette was out of town), and he had trouble disagreeing with others. His low self- confidence, discomfort at being alone, and rush into another marriage when the first one ended provide a strong basis for the diagnosis of dependent personality disorder. Other patients might qualify for borderline personality disorder. Bud\u2019s GAF score\u2014 61\u2014would be based more on the personality disorder than on the arousal disorder. Associated conditions in other patients can include posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

Z63.0 [V61.10] Partner relationship distress F51.4 [307.46] Non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder, sleep terror type F60.7 [301.6] Dependent personality disorder confusional arousals occur during the transition from non-REM sleep to wakefulness. The person seems awake but is confused and disoriented, and may behave inappropriately (hence the term sometimes used, sleep drunkenness). an episode may be set up by sleep deprivation or by bedtime use of alcohol or hyp - notics. Sometimes triggered by a forced awakening, it may begin with physical movements and moaning, then progress to agitation during which the individual (with eyes open or closed) calls out and thrashes about, but cannot awaken. More complex behaviors may occur: sitting up, speaking incoherently, and performing actions that are purposeful though illogical (and, at times, dangerous). beginning over a century ago, various authors have published collections of violent crimes committed during states of confused arousal. These include at least a score of mur- ders, mostly committed by persons who had had a personal (or, sometimes, family) history of sleep disorder. The lack of culpability of a sleeper who killed or wounded someone was Non-rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders 335 noted as far back as 14th- century France; the principle was affirmed in subsequent cen - turies in Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. attempts at comfort are met with resistance and may even increase the person\u2019s agitation. The episode typically lasts 5\u201315 minutes, occasionally longer, before calm is restored and normal sleep returns. a mnesia for the event is typical; the individual usu - ally doesn\u2019t even recall having a dream. When injury occurs, it may be because someone approached or attempted to interfere with a person who was asleep. It is also important\u2014 and reassuring\u2014to note that, by a wide margin, most episodes of confusional arousal do not involve aggression or violence. although this relative newcomer (it was first noted in 1968) is said to occur mainly in infants and toddlers, it has also been self- reported in 3\u20134% of people age 15 and over.

    "self- reported in 3\u20134% of people age 15 and over. Males and females are represented about equally; shift and night workers may be espe - cially vulnerable. G25.81 [333.94] Restless Legs Syndrome Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an evil complaint that clinicians sometimes ignore because it seriously threatens no one; however, it inflicts exquisite torment upon its suf- ferers. Not usually painful, it\u2019s a nearly indescribable discomfort deep within the lower legs that\u2019s relieved only by movement, yielding an irresistible urge to shift leg positions every few seconds (trust me on this). Patients will tell you that the sensation feels like itching, tingling, creeping, or crawling, but none of these descriptors quite encapsulates a condition that confers seemingly inconsequential misery unimaginable by someone who\u2019s not afflicted. With a tendency to begin before bedtime, this common disorder can delay onset of sleep; sometimes it awakens the patient during the night. It\u2019s associated with disturbed sleep and reduced sleep time. Relief can come in many guises\u2014 walking, pacing, stretching, rubbing, even riding a stationary bicycle. The trouble is that each of these stratagems increases wakefulness. Besides causing the person to feel tired the next day, RLS can lead to depression and anxiety. It tends to lessen throughout the night, allowing more refreshing sleep toward morning. Overall, it worsens with time, though it may wax and wane over a period of weeks. It\u2019s been associated with major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder. Nobody\u2019s really sure why RLS occurs, though it may be related to the neurotrans- mitter dopamine. (It\u2019s often reported by patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, whose basal ganglia are compromised.) One- quarter of pregnant women report it, especially in the third trimester. It\u2019s also found in neurological conditions such as neuropathy and mul- tiple sclerosis, and in iron deficiency and renal failure. RLS can be exacerbated by medications, including antihistamines, antinausea preparations, mirtazapine (Rem - eron), and some other antidepressants. The effects of mild obstructive sleep apnea can sometimes look like periodic limb movements. 336 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS If asked, perhaps 2% of people in the general population will complain of RLS serious enough to cause impaired functioning (mostly disturbed sleep); it has even been reported by perhaps 1% of school-age children.

    "population will complain of RLS serious enough to cause impaired functioning (mostly disturbed sleep); it has even been reported by perhaps 1% of school-age children. It\u2019s more frequent in European Ameri- cans, and less so in people of Asian descent; the prevalence in women may be greater than in men. It tends to begin relatively early in life (the teens or 20s). Sometimes you\u2019ll find a family history positive for RLS; genetic markers have been identified. A simple interview is usually enough to make the diagnosis. Especially alert readers may be asking themselves: Why is RLS even a sleep disorder? What does it have to do with sleep? First, RLS has a diurnal component to it, similar to the ebb and flow of other issues regarding sleep. Second, it can delay sleep onset; occasion - ally it even awakens patients during the night. Finally, RLS can result in daytime hypersom- nolence\u2014often a cause of distress or impaired functioning. If this logic doesn\u2019t appeal to you straight off, I suggest that you sleep on it. Essential Features of restless Legs Syndrome Unpleasant leg sensations cause an impulse to move them, which tends to relieve the symptoms. Legs are most restless in the evening or later.

He had twice viewed the digital replay of the 10 p.m. news, and had cringed at what he saw: a middle- aged anchorman whose Max Factor could barely conceal the deepening worry lines. His wandering gaze seemed to resist gazing directly at the camera; his hooded eyes betrayed trouble focusing on the script. He could almost visualize his feet tap- dancing nervously beneath the polished table that served as his on- camera desk. In fact, concentration was a big problem: Enoch could so easily drift off into rev - erie, away from whatever was going on about him. Just last week, the floor director had said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, E? Lately you don\u2019t seem to be quite with the program\u2014so to speak.\u201d restless Legs Syndrome 337 Well, true enough, he supposed.

Lately you don\u2019t seem to be quite with the program\u2014so to speak.\u201d restless Legs Syndrome 337 Well, true enough, he supposed. He\u2019d been fine until the last 3 or 4 weeks, but lately he hadn\u2019t enough interest to sustain a run on a small bank. (His joke was an out - take from a special they\u2019d recently aired on the financial system.) Always a conscien - tious performer, now he took no pleasure in his craft; indeed, he no longer felt good about much of anything. Even sex bored him. Nothing had seemed to put Enoch off, just the gradual realization that his life wasn\u2019t moving in a positive direction; he\u2019d began to feel uneasy, a sense that \u201csomething terrible was afoot.\u201d Was he depressed? That\u2019s what his wife kept asking, but he didn\u2019t feel depressed. It\u2019s not that he went around crying all the time, for God\u2019s sake. He certainly didn\u2019t feel especially good. Food didn\u2019t taste right, so his appetite must have seemed a bit off. And he\u2019d never considered doing himself in. From a network documentary he\u2019d introduced a couple of months ago, he knew enough to pay attention to thoughts about dying and suicide. \u201cWell, you sure look depressed to me!\u201d was his wife\u2019s latest word on the subject. But not, he suspected, her last. Enoch decided he just needed to be calm. He was calm, on camera. But whenever he started thinking about himself and his family, his insides roiled. He hoped that his public demeanor\u2014 artificial smiles and manufactured bonhomie\u2014 concealed the mis- ery he felt. No, what he felt was more like pepless. Fatigued. That was it. So tired he had trouble dragging himself out of bed, even after he\u2019d slept his usual 8 hours. Maybe that could explain the peculiar sort of tension in his muscles, like his biceps were coiled springs that never, ever released. Probably because he was just too damned tired and he couldn\u2019t relax, even in his hot tub. That tension was different from the peculiar sensation he\u2019d had in his legs for a couple of years now. He could hardly sit still long enough to get through his half hour on camera. He had worried\u2014could it indicate some weird form of cancer, buried deep within the calf of his leg? Legs, actually, for both of them gave him",
    "in his legs for a couple of years now. He could hardly sit still long enough to get through his half hour on camera. He had worried\u2014could it indicate some weird form of cancer, buried deep within the calf of his leg? Legs, actually, for both of them gave him fits. Getting up and walking around, even for a moment, relieved the sensation completely, but he couldn\u2019t do that when he was broadcasting. At night in bed, he so often had to get up and walk that he felt wiped out the next day. But while working, even the relief of pacing was denied him. \u201cI should have been a weatherman,\u201d he\u2019d thought more than once. As it was, the only on-air relief from the jittery legs was to try to rub them together under the desk. It was worse when he was lying down, worst of all in the evening. (\u201cOr do a morning show.\u201d) Strangely (for him, because he wasn\u2019t really a worrywart), lately he kept thinking he\u2019d be fired. Not that he had much reason to worry\u2014he lived the risible clich\u00e9 of being married to the boss\u2019s daughter. Of course, that wasn\u2019t doing him much good, either. They hadn\u2019t made love for a couple of months; he just didn\u2019t feel interested, in that or much of anything else. He felt ashamed of his physique, though Kristin said she loved the way he looked. Still, he had reflected more than once that someone born Oliver Schmick wasn\u2019t likely to find jobs thick on the ground. 338 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS Evaluation of Enoch Dimond Enoch had two problems: one with his mood, one with his legs. The former was the more tendentious, so I\u2019ll save that discussion for later. Enoch had all the important symptoms traditionally associated with RLS: the peculiar, uncontrollable sensation in both legs (criterion A), which led to the irresist - ible urge to seek relief in movement (A2), was present only when he was inactive or resting (A1), and was worse in the evening (A3). His sleep suffered and he often felt \u201cwiped out\u201d the following day (C), and its frequency and duration qualified for the diagnosis (B)\u2014provided that no other diagnosis seemed more appropriate (D, E). To that end, his blood chemistries should be checked for iron deficiency anemia and renal failure. And so we come to the matter of Enoch\u2019s mood. Here\u2019s the",
    "following day (C), and its frequency and duration qualified for the diagnosis (B)\u2014provided that no other diagnosis seemed more appropriate (D, E). To that end, his blood chemistries should be checked for iron deficiency anemia and renal failure. And so we come to the matter of Enoch\u2019s mood. Here\u2019s the problem: He had sev- eral depressive symptoms (low interest, lack of pleasure, fatigue), but not enough for a major depressive episode. He also had a feeling of uneasy anticipation combined with tension and worry, though not enough of these to sustain a diagnosis of either panic dis- order or generalized anxiety disorder. At one time, the authors of DSM-5 considered a diagnosis of mixed anxiety\u2013 depression (which would require a perhaps too- delicate balancing of criteria so as not to meet full criteria for any other mood or anxiety disor - der). But that diagnosis was never adopted. Now, if we made any diagnosis at all, we\u2019d have to say that Enoch had an unidentified form of depression, described in DSM-5 as other specified depressive disorder. If these symptoms later turned into major depres- sion, we might add the specifier with anxious distress. However, I\u2019d be happy to wait a few days to see whether his depressive and anxiety symptoms would clear up spontaneously. Sometimes we\u2019re a tad too ready with a diag- nosis when a tincture of time can sort things out. Being too quick off the mark can lead to diagnosis where none is justified and treatment where none is indicated. Actually, the problem of separating out the symptoms of multiple diagnoses occurs pretty often and across every DSM-5 chapter. For example, how do we decide whether the peculiar sensation in Enoch\u2019s legs was due to agitated mood disorder or something else entirely? Two principles should guide us away from the former interpretation: (1) Enoch\u2019s motor activity was not generalized, but limited to his lower extremities; (2) and, more importantly, it preceded the other mood and anxiety symptoms by at least a year. All in all, I\u2019d give Enoch Dimond only the one firm diagnosis, though we should real - ize that it is not at all a benign one: RLS can lead to insomnia and other complications. I\u2019d also assign a GAF score of 61. If my record room demanded a coded diagnosis, I\u2019d waffle a bit and use other specified depressive disorder, as you can see",

Because most contemporary nightmares quickly bring us full awake, we tend to recall them vividly. They are usually about something that threatens either our safety or our self- esteem. When someone repeatedly has long, ter- rifying dreams of that sort, or suffers from daytime sleepiness, irritability, or loss of concentration, a diagnosis of nightmare disorder may be warranted. Nightmares develop during REM sleep, most of which occurs toward the end of the night. (Onset early during the sleep period is noteworthy enough to earn a specifier.) They can be increased by withdrawal from REM-suppressing substances; these include antidepressants, barbiturates, and alcohol. Although some degree of rapid heartbeat is common, people with nightmares generally have fewer symptoms of sympathetic nervous system arousal (perspiration, rapid heartbeat, increased blood pressure) than do sufferers from the sleep terror type of non-REM sleep arousal disorder. Childhood nightmares, especially those that occur in young children, have no pathological significance. About half of all adults report nightmares at some time or other. The number who have enough nightmares to be considered pathological is unknown, though perhaps 5% of adults claim to have frequent nightmares. They may be more common in women than in men. To some extent, the tendency to have night - mares may be inherited. Although adults with frequent nightmares probably have a tendency to psycho - pathology, there is no consensus among sleep experts as to what that psychopathology might be. (When it is sorted out, it may turn out that the pathology has more to do with who complains than with the actual nightmare experience.)

Vivid nightmares some - times precede the onset of a psychosis. However, most nightmares may be an expected (and hence normal) reaction to stress; some clinicians believe that they help people to work through traumatic experiences. at least half the population has had a nightmare at one time or another. So do all of these people (that is, do we ) have a sleep\u2013wake disorder? a s with so many other conditions, making this decision is a matter of quantity (number of nightmare episodes) and of the reaction a patient has to the episodes. These factors must then be filtered through the judgment of the clinician.

I think they really stayed to make sure I kept the appointment.\u201d After 6 months in the Army, Keith had just been promoted to private first class.

Now he\u2019d been at his new duty sta- tion in Texas for 2 weeks, living in comparative luxury in a barracks room with three roommates. Nightmare Disorder 341 Having any roommates at all was a problem, because of his sleeping habits. \u201cI have these nightmares,\u201d Keith explained. They didn\u2019t occur every night, but he did have them several nights a week. He usually awakened an hour or two before reveille, whim- pering loudly enough to awaken the others. He\u2019d been having this problem for several years, so he was more or less used to it. But, of course, his roommates objected. It had been worse in the last few months, with the stress of leaving home, moving around, and working at new jobs. Although Keith\u2019s dreams varied, there were some common threads. In one of them he was in a group of people, buck naked. Recently it had been during inspection. All the other troops were lined up, looking smart in their Class A uniforms. He hadn\u2019t a stitch on, and he kept trying to cover himself, though no one seemed to notice. In another, he was the driver of an old \u201ccracker-box\u201d ambulance. For some reason, he had picked up a wounded gorilla. Maddened with pain, the gorilla was pulling itself forward and stretching out a hairy arm to wrap around him. \u201cUnfortunately, I have terrific recall. I come instantly awake, and every detail of the nightmare is just as sharp as if I\u2019d seen it on TV. Then I\u2019m awake for an hour or more, and so is everyone else.\u201d The balance of Keith\u2019s history was unremarkable. He didn\u2019t use drugs and didn\u2019t drink; his health had been good, and he hadn\u2019t been especially depressed or anxious. He had never had blackouts or seizures, and he hadn\u2019t been taking medications. He loved his job in the dispensary and believed that his commanding officer found him to be alert and conscientious. He certainly wasn\u2019t falling asleep on the job. \u201cI\u2019ve met some older guys who\u2019ve had nightmares after being in combat,\u201d Keith said. \u201cI can understand that.

But about the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me since I enlisted has been a flat tire.\u201d Evaluation of Keith Redding Keith\u2019s nightmares didn\u2019t bother him much; he had grown used to them. It was his discomfort in regard to his roommates that would qualify his nightmares as sufficiently severe to warrant diagnosis (criterion C). Three aspects of Keith\u2019s experience are typical of most nightmares: They occurred during the latter part of the night; he awakened fully and instantly (B); and he clearly recalled their content (typically threats to his safety or self- respect\u2014A). Each of these features serves to differentiate nightmare disorder from non-REM sleep arousal disor- der, sleep terror type: Sleep terrors occur early during non-REM sleep; they are poorly remembered; and the patient wakens only partially, if at all. Finally, although there may be some vocalization (for Keith, a suppressed whine) when the patient is about to awaken, the paralysis of muscles that normally occurs during REM sleep prevents the loud scream and physical movements that are typical of sleep terrors. If the patient\u2019s complaint is of daytime sleepiness, other causes should be con - sidered, such as some form of sleep apnea. Keith did not have daytime sleep attacks, though nightmares can be a feature of narcolepsy. Also consider the variety of other 342 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS disorders in which nightmares can occur: mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety dis- orders, somatic symptom disorder, adjustment disorder, and personality disorders (E). The fact that Keith had been taking no medications is also important to the dif - ferential diagnosis, because withdrawal from REM-suppressing substances such as tri- cyclic antidepressants, alcohol, or barbiturates can sometimes increase the tendency to nightmares (D). Seizure disorders (such as partial complex seizures) can occasionally present with bad dreams; abnormal movements noted by a bed partner during the time of the apparent nightmare could be an indication for EEG studies (E). As Keith himself noted, nightmares about a traumatic event are frequently encountered in patients who have posttraumatic stress disorder (these may occur in non-REM sleep, which is why patients with PTSD are more likely to scream). Keith would qualify for a GAF score of 75. His full diagnosis would be simple: F51.5 [307.47] Nightmare disorder, persistent, moderate G47.52 [327.42] Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder",

His full diagnosis would be simple: F51.5 [307.47] Nightmare disorder, persistent, moderate G47.52 [327.42] Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder During normal REM sleep, our skeletal muscles are paralyzed, which protects us from injury while we\u2019re unconscious. But for people with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), that mechanism sometimes fails. Then dreams play out as activity, and mischief can ensue. Although the motor behaviors in question may consist only of mild twitches, they can escalate to sudden, sometimes violent movements\u2014by punching, kicking, or even biting, people can sometimes seriously harm themselves or a bed partner. Instead of gross motor behavior, or sometimes in addition to it, patients will sometimes whisper, talk, shout, swear, laugh, or cry. But the overall prevalence of injury to self or others is over 90%. Usually these patients keep their eyes closed\u2014 another difference from sleepwalk- ing\u2014and it\u2019s rare that they get out of bed. Upon awakening, which they readily do, many patients with RBD report vivid dreams, often of being threatened or attacked by animals or people. Overt behavior may closely reflect their dream content, sometimes called \u201cacting out their dreams.\u201d Occasionally, a funny dream can cause smiling or laughter. When severe, these behaviors occur as often as weekly or even greater. Patients with RBD are overwhelmingly (80% or more) male. The usual onset is after age 50, so the typical patient is a middle-aged or older man. However, even chil - dren can be affected. Up to a third of patients are unaware of their symptoms, and perhaps half don\u2019t recall having unpleasant dreams. Overall, the condition affects less than 1% of the general adult population. The initial diagnosis can be suspected from the observations of a bed partner; confirmation (with one exception) requires polysomnography. And here\u2019s the exception: The patient has symptoms that suggest RBD and a synucleinopathy condition such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and some others (see the sidebar below). rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder 343 Of patients who present to sleep clinics with R bD, about half will have or develop one of these illnesses: Lewy body dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, or multiple- system atrophy.

    "Sleep Behavior Disorder 343 Of patients who present to sleep clinics with R bD, about half will have or develop one of these illnesses: Lewy body dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, or multiple- system atrophy. These are collectively referred to as synucleinopathies, because their underlying cause is abnormal intracellular masses of the protein \u03b1-synuclein. This is the only example I can think of where a mental health disorder is thought to powerfully predict a medical illness whose onset may lie far in the future. We can perhaps feel both encouraged and appalled. Essential Features of rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder The patient has recurrent episodes of arousing from sleep accompanied by shouting or speech, or by physical actions that can injure the patient or bed partner. These symptoms often correlate with dream content. Subsequent awakenings tend to be complete. Because they occur during REM sleep, these episodes tend to take place after the person has been asleep quite a while, and not during naps. The Fine Print If the person has a typical history as described above, together with a synucleinopa- thy (such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or Lewy body dementia), no polysomnography is necessary. Without this history, there must be polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep with maintenance of muscle tone. The D\u2019s: \u2022 Distress or disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Dif- ferential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders, other sleep\u2013wake disorders) Jackson Rudy Jackson Rudy attracted considerable clinical attention when he nearly died in the restraint he\u2019d rigged for himself. One November dawn, his wife, Shawna, had had to call the paramedics. For several years, Jackson explained later, he had had really vivid dreams. Usu - ally these were benign, but once in a while \u201cI\u2019d dream I was being chased by big furry animals with slavering jaws. Then they\u2019d turn from biting me to attack Shawna.\u201d In his sleep, he would lash out with fists and feet, but of course the only available target was his wife. \u201cI thought I had to keep her safe\u2014but I guess it was from me!\u201d As a boy, Jackson had lived on a ranch where wolves still roamed. Though he\u2019d never seen one actually attack, more than once he had witnessed them prowling around the family\u2019s cattle.

Several months ago, when his nocturnal behavior was limited to yelling or some - times jerking his arms and legs around, he had consulted his primary care provider. \u201cShe thought I could sleep in the guest room. Shawna and I both thought that was 344 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS lame.\u201d So Jackson had dusted off the leatherworking skills from his ranch days and con- structed a tether to restrain his movements. \u201cIt was supposed to loop around my arms and chest to keep me from slugging her,\u201d he said, \u201conly I sort of got tangled up in it. It nearly hanged me.\u201d With Jackson\u2019s permission, the clinician interviewed Shawna. She affirmed that his attacks came mostly in the predawn hours, and that when he awakened, he came instantly and completely alert. Had he been depressed? Did he drink or use drugs or medication? (Negatives all around.) Was his interest good in things generally? In sex? Shawna smiled. \u201cEven at 60, he\u2019s much better at lovemaking than at inventing.\u201d Evaluation of Jackson Rudy First, let\u2019s dispose of the criteria. We know from the history (including Shawna\u2019s help- ful information) that Jackson\u2019s episodes were repeated and physical (criterion A), that they occurred while he was dreaming later in the night (not when first falling asleep\u2014 criterion B), and that they appeared to be a physical enactment of his dreams. He awak- ened right away (C), and hadn\u2019t been using drink, drugs, or medications that might cause similar behaviors (F). The arrival of the paramedics tells us that the behavior was dangerous and clinically important (E). Polysomnography could also help with the differential diagnosis of some other dis- orders that entail violence during sleep: both the sleepwalking and sleep terror types of non-REM sleep arousal disorder, nocturnal seizures, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. However, his history isn\u2019t strong for any of these disorders, and I feel comfort- able putting them aside. There\u2019s no evidence for other medical or mental disorders (G). The remaining criterion (D), verification by polysomnography, isn\u2019t quite as vital as DSM-5 might lead us to believe. Some experts state that we can omit it in relatively mild cases, where there\u2019s no significant worry about other disorders. But with the severity of Jackson\u2019s lashing out, safety is",

Some experts state that we can omit it in relatively mild cases, where there\u2019s no significant worry about other disorders. But with the severity of Jackson\u2019s lashing out, safety is the better part of evaluation. Jackson probably wouldn\u2019t consider himself old yet, but still we need to know that he has none of the degenerative neurological disorders that can be the source of RBD: Lewy body dementia (about 70% of cases are associated with RBD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (50%), and multiple- system atrophy (upwards of 90%). RBD is also found in strokes, tumors, and some medications (beta blockers, some antidepressants), though it\u2019s rare in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Because of the circumstances in which Jackson nearly died, a few questions about paraphilias would be warranted, and his clinician would want to keep in mind the pos- sibility of a suicide attempt\u2014a red herring here, but something that we must always keep in mind. Jackson Rudy\u2019s diagnosis is listed below. Although the paramedics were called, I\u2019d say that any danger to himself was a one-off, unlikely to be repeated. I\u2019d put his GAF score at a comfortable 70. His doctor should observe him carefully for development of an additional disorder (see the sidebar above). G47.52 [327.42] Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder 345 Other Sleep\u2013Wake Disorders Substance/Medication- Induced Sleep Disorder As you might expect, substances of abuse can produce a variety of sleep disorders, most of which will be either insomnia or hypersomnolence. The specific problem with sleep can occur during either intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol. Heavy alcohol use (intoxication) can produce unrefreshing sleep with strong REM suppression and reduced total sleep time. Patients may experience terminal insomnia and sometimes hypersomnolence, and their sleep problems may persist for years. Alcohol withdrawal markedly increases sleep onset latency and produces restless sleep with frequent awakenings. Patients may experience delirium with tremor and (especially visual) hallucinations; this was formerly known as delirium tremens. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. These include barbiturates, over-the- counter antihistamines and bromides, short- acting benzodiazepines, and high doses of long- acting benzodiazepines. Any of these substances may be used in the attempt to remedy insomnia of another origin. They can lead to sleep disorder dur- ing either intoxication or withdrawal. Central nervous system stimulants.

Any of these substances may be used in the attempt to remedy insomnia of another origin. They can lead to sleep disorder dur- ing either intoxication or withdrawal. Central nervous system stimulants. Amphetamines and other stimulants typically cause increased latency of sleep onset, decreased REM sleep, and more awaken - ings. Once the drug is discontinued, hypersomnolence with restlessness and REM rebound dreams may ensue. Caffeine. This popular drug produces insomnia with intoxication and hypersom - nolence upon withdrawal (no surprises here). Other drugs. These include tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, ACTH, anti - convulsants, thyroid medications, marijuana, cocaine, LSD, opioids, PCP, and methyldopa. Essential Features of Substance/Medication\u2013 Induced Sleep Disorder The use of some substance appears to have caused a patient to have a serious sleep problem. The Fine Print For tips on identifying substance- related causation, see sidebar, page 95. The D\u2019s: \u2022 Distress or disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (physical disorders, delirium, other sleep disorders) 346 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS You\u2019d only make this diagnosis when the symptoms are serious enough to war- rant clinical attention and they are worse than you\u2019d expect from ordinary intoxica- tion or withdrawal. Coding Notes ICD-9 kept coding simple: 291.82 for alcohol, 292.85 for all other substances. Coding in ICD-10 depends on the substance used and on whether symptoms are met for an actual substance use disorder (and, if so, how severe the use disorder is). Refer to Table 15.2 in Chapter 15. Specify: With onset during {intoxication}{withdrawal}. This gets tacked on at the end of your string of words. With onset after medication use. You can use this in addition to other specifiers. (See sidebar, p. 94.) Specify: Insomnia type Daytime sleepiness type Parasomnia type (abnormal behavior when sleeping) Mixed type Dave Kincaid Dave Kincaid was a free-lance writer. As Dave explained it to his clinician, \u201cfree-lance\u201d was the industry\u2019s way of saying that you were unemployed. He\u2019d actually done reason- ably well for himself, specializing in interviews with unimportant (but very interesting) people.

    "of his work was published in small magazines and specialized reviews. His novel and a volume of travel essays had been remaindered early, with good reviews but disappointing sales. When he had to, Dave supplemented his income by taking temporary jobs. To gather material for his writing, he tried to make his jobs as varied as possible. He had driven a taxi, been a bouncer at a bar, sold real estate, and (in his younger days) served as a guide on the Jungle River Cruise at Disneyland. Now 35, he had been supporting his third book, a murder mystery, for the last several weeks by working in a coffee roast- ery north of San Francisco. The job didn\u2019t pay much over minimum wage, but neither was it very demanding. Except for the busy 2 or 3 hours around noon, it left him with plenty of time for blocking out a section of his book to work on that night. It also left Dave time to drink coffee. Besides grinding beans or selling them whole, the roastery served coffee by the cup. Employees could drink what they wanted. Dave was a coffee drinker, but he had always limited himself to three or four cups a day. \u201cIt sure isn\u2019t enough to explain the way I\u2019m feeling now.\u201d Substance/Medication- Induced Sleep Disorder 347 How he felt was, in a word, nervous. It was worst at night. \u201cI have this uncomfort- able, \u2018up\u2019 sort of feeling, and I want to write. But sometimes I just can\u2019t sit still at the word processor. I get that \u2018live flesh\u2019 sensation when your muscles twitch. And my heart beats fast and my gut seems to pour out water, so I have to spend a lot of time in the bathroom.\u201d Dave seldom got to sleep before 2 a.m., sometimes after much tossing and turning. On Sundays he slept until noon, but on Monday through Saturday he awakened to his alarm, feeling hung over and in desperate need of a cup of coffee. Dave\u2019s health had been excellent, which was a good thing because he\u2019d seldom had a job with a health plan. Other than the mornings, his mood was good. He had tried marijuana in the past, but didn\u2019t like it. He confined his drinking to coffee, but \u201conly three or four cups a day,\u201d he said again. He also denied drinking tea, cocoa, or cola",

He confined his drinking to coffee, but \u201conly three or four cups a day,\u201d he said again. He also denied drinking tea, cocoa, or cola bev- erages. After a moment he added, \u201cOf course, there are the coffee beans.\u201d When things were slow in the afternoon and Dave was thinking about his novel, he would dip into the supply of candy- coated coffee beans the roastery also sold (for $11.95 the half-pound). They came coated in white or dark chocolate; he preferred the dark. They also had decaffeinated beans, but these were dipped in yogurt, which he didn\u2019t care for at all. \u201cI don\u2019t keep track,\u201d said Dave, \u201cbut all in all, every afternoon I probably have a few handfuls. Or so.\u201d Evaluation of Dave Kincaid Although Dave drank fairly modest amounts of coffee, it was very strong and by itself probably contained more than the 250 mg or so usually required for caffeine intoxica - tion. He also ate coffee beans; depending on the origin of the beans, it takes perhaps 70 beans to make a strong cup of brewed coffee, and he consumed chocolate- coated beans by the handful. That way, he may have eaten the equivalent of one or two additional cups of coffee per day. (In addition, chocolate contains theobromine, a xanthine with effects similar to caffeine.) No wonder he felt nervous. In its proper place (p. 417), I\u2019ll discuss Dave\u2019s symptoms of caffeinism. In conjunction with his caffeine use, Dave noted increased latency of sleep onset. He felt tired when it was time to get up, and he had to use coffee to get going. Therefore, the basic criteria for substance- induced sleep disorder were all met: Use of a substance caused (criterion B1) a problem with sleep serious enough to require clinical attention (A, E). Of course, caffeine is famously associated with sleeplessness. Sure, you could think up all manner of other sleep disorders that could cause Dave\u2019s symptoms (C, D)\u2014but the rational course would be to eliminate (gradually!) the caffeine use, then reassess the patient\u2019s sleep. This was what Dave\u2019s clinician did. In some cases, there can be confusion as to the etiological contributions of physical illness and the medications that are used to treat it. At times,",

In some cases, there can be confusion as to the etiological contributions of physical illness and the medications that are used to treat it. At times, two diagnoses may be warranted. With the subtype specifiers required in the criteria (and a GAF score of 65), Dave\u2019s diagnosis would be as follows: 348 SLEEP\u2013WAKE DISO rDErS F15.929 [305.90] Caffeine intoxication, moderate F15.982 [292.85] Caffeine- induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, with onset during intoxication The diagnosis of a substance- induced anything rests on deciding that the symptoms are more serious than you\u2019d expect from ordinary substance intoxication or withdrawal. This is a judgment call. In the case of Dave Kincaid, the symptoms were sufficiently prominent to bring him for evaluation. G47.09 [780.52] Other Specified Insomnia Disorder DSM-5 gives these examples: Brief insomnia disorder. Insomnia lasting less than 3 months. Restricted to nonrestorative sleep. The person doesn\u2019t feel refreshed by sleep that is otherwise unremarkable. G47.00 [780.52] Unspecified Insomnia Disorder Use unspecified insomnia disorder when a patient\u2019s insomnia symptoms do not meet the full criteria for insomnia disorder (or any other sleep disorder) and you decide not to be specific about the reasons.

In DSM-IV and before, they were all included in the same chapter; now the sexual dysfunctions, gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders are spread out over three different chapters. As with most other diagnoses, patients can have problems in multiple areas, which can in turn coex- ist with other mental diagnoses. With the exception of substance- induced sexual dysfunction, the sexual dysfunctions are gender- specific. DSM-5\u2019s organization is alphabetical; I\u2019ve grouped these disorders by gender and stage in an act of sex at which the dysfunction occurs.

The page number follow- ing each item indicates where a more detailed discussion begins. Sexual Dysfunctions Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The patient isn\u2019t much interested in sex, though his performance may be adequate once sexual activity has been initiated (p. 352). Erectile disorder. A man\u2019s erection isn\u2019t sufficient to begin or complete sexual relations (p. 355). Premature (early) ejaculation. A man experiences repeated instances of climax before, dur- ing, or just after penetration (p. 357). Delayed ejaculation. Despite a normal period of sexual excitement, a man\u2019s climax is either delayed or does not occur at all (p. 359). Female sexual interest/arousal disorder. A woman lacks interest in sex or does not become aroused enough (p. 362). Genito- pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Genital pain occurs (only in women) during sexual intercourse, often during insertion (p. 364). Female orgasmic disorder. Despite a normal period of sexual excitement, a woman\u2019s climax either is delayed or does not occur at all (p. 368). Substance/medication- induced sexual dysfunction. Many of these problems can also be caused by intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol or other substances (p. 370). Other specified, or unspecified, sexual dysfunction. These are catch-all categories for sexual problems that do not meet the criteria for any of the foregoing sexual dysfunctions (p. 371). Other Causes of Sexual Difficulties Paraphilic disorders. These include a variety of behaviors that most people regard as dis - tasteful, unusual, or abnormal. Nearly all are practiced almost exclusively by males (p. 564). Gender dysphoria. Some people strongly identify so strongly with the opposite gender that they are uncomfortable with their assigned gender roles (p. 372). Nonsexual mental disorders. Many patients develop sexual dysfunctions as a result of other mental disorders. Lack of interest in sex may be encountered especially in somatic symptom disorder (p. 251), major depressive disorder (p. 122), and schizophrenia (p. 64). Introduction The sexual dysfunctions usually begin in early adulthood, though some may not appear until later in life\u2014 whenever the opportunity for sexual experience arises. Most of them are quite common. Any of them can be caused by psychological or biological factors or by a combination of these.

    "later in life\u2014 whenever the opportunity for sexual experience arises. Most of them are quite common. Any of them can be caused by psychological or biological factors or by a combination of these. Ordinarily, we wouldn\u2019t use one of these diagnoses if the behavior occurs only in the course of another mental disorder. Also, any of these dysfunctions can be lifelong or acquired. Lifelong (also called primary) means that this dysfunction has been present since the beginning of active sexual functioning. Acquired means that at some time the patient has been able to have sex without that particular dysfunction. As you might imagine, lifelong dysfunctions are vastly more resistant to therapy. Furthermore, most sexual dysfunctions may be either generalized or situational (that is, limited to specific situations). For example, a man may experience premature ejaculation with his wife but not with another woman. Some dysfunctions may not even require that the patient have a partner; they can occur during masturbation, for example. (Generalized and situational don\u2019t apply to genito- pelvic pain/penetration dis- order.) DSM-5 has tightened its advice on how much dysfunction is required for diag - nosis. The patient must have the symptoms on the majority of occasions (in criteria sets, it is phrased as \u201calmost all or all\u201d) of sexual activity over a 6-month period\u2014and Introduction 351 those phrases have been explicitly, and confusingly, defined as meaning 75% or more. However, the criteria also specify that they must cause \u201cclinically significant distress,\u201d leaving some room for clinician judgment based on how long the problem has existed and the degree to which the problem affects patient and partner. This judgment will be influenced by the circumstances surrounding the particular sex activity\u2014such as degree of sexual stimulation, the amount of that activity, and with whom it occurs. For example, female sexual interest/arousal disorder should not be diagnosed if it occurs only when intercourse is attempted after little or no foreplay. In addition to these considerations, here are some additional factors to take into account. (Note that in DSM-IV they were subtypes that we added to the official title of each sexual disorder; DSM-5 has in essence demoted them to an advisory capacity.) \u2022\u2022 Partner factors (such as partner\u2019s sexual problems or health status) \u2022\u2022 Relationship factors (such as poor communication, relationship discord, discrep- ancies in desire for sexual activity) \u2022\u2022 Individual vulnerability factors (such as a history of abuse or",

An alert clinician may be able to make a diagnosis of one or more of these conditions in a patient who comes for consultation regarding unrelated mental health problems. F52.0 [302.71] Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder Relatively little is known about low sex interest and desire in men, compared to women. This has partly resulted from the unfounded assumption that it is uncommon. Yet, in a 1994 survey of over 1,400 men, 16% agreed that they had had a period of several months when they were not interested in sex (compared with 33% for women.) These men tended to be older, never married, not highly educated, black, and poor. Com - pared to other men, they were more likely to have been inappropriately \u201ctouched\u201d before puberty, to have experienced homosexual activity at some time in their lives, and to use alcohol daily. Even a few percent of young men (in their 20s) will admit to rela - tive lack of sexual desire, though it seldom rises to the level of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder (MHSDD). MHSDD can be primary or acquired. The (relatively less common) primary type has been associated with some sort of sexual secret (such as shame about sexual ori - entation, past sexual trauma, perhaps a preference for masturbation over sex with a 352 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS partner). Such a man\u2019s low sex desire may be masked by the effect of a new romance; this glow typically persists for only a matter of months before frustration and heartache (and more secrecy) set in, for patient and partner alike. Acquired MHSDD is the more common pattern. It often develops as a conse - quence of dysfunctions of erection or ejaculation (early or delayed). These in turn can stem from a variety",
    "a matter of months before frustration and heartache (and more secrecy) set in, for patient and partner alike. Acquired MHSDD is the more common pattern. It often develops as a conse - quence of dysfunctions of erection or ejaculation (early or delayed). These in turn can stem from a variety of causes: diabetes, hypertension, substance use, mood or anxiety disorders, sometimes a lack of intimacy with a partner. Whatever the origin, the man\u2019s confidence in his ability to achieve or maintain an erection (or to satisfy his partner) yields to a pattern of anticipatory anxiety and failure. He has trouble admitting that his sexual relationship is less than perfect, and so he retires from the fray, so to speak, defeated and uncommunicative. Such a pattern can begin at almost any stage of life, though about two out of three couples stop having sex by their mid-70s. At any age, when this happens to heterosexual couples, it is overwhelmingly (90%) likely to be at the man\u2019s initiative. Essential Features of Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder A man lacks erotic thoughts or wishes for sexual activity. The Fine Print The clinician must judge the deficiency in light of age and other factors that can affect sexual function. The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (6+ months) \u2022 Distress to the patient \u2022 Differential diagnosis (sub- stance use and physical disorders, relationship problems, other mental disorders) Coding Notes Specify: {Lifelong}{Acquired} {Generalized}{Situational} Specify severity of distress over the symptoms: {Mild}{Moderate}{Severe} Nigel O\u2019Neil \u201cShe\u2019s not your typical trophy wife,\u201d Nigel O\u2019Neil told the therapist in confidence. \u201cI love Gemma because she\u2019s so competent, so organized\u2014and such a nice person,\u201d he added, almost as an afterthought. \u201cBut she just doesn\u2019t turn me on the way Bea used to.\u201d At age 53, Nigel was well into his second marriage, solemnized 3 years after his first wife died of malignant melanoma. For several years, Gemma had been his per - sonal assistant in the office where he worked for a large publisher. Around the time of Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder 353 Bea\u2019s death, he had turned to her for more than his morning mug of Darjeeling. During his first session, he admitted that he still felt guilty about that.

    "than his morning mug of Darjeeling. During his first session, he admitted that he still felt guilty about that. Born in London, Nigel had been reared a strict Catholic. \u201cThat operationalized to the fact that, before we were married, Bea and I hadn\u2019t done much more than a little fooling around. We were very young and inexperienced.\u201d Afterwards, he had been able to obtain and maintain an erection satisfactory for intercourse \u201cmost of the time, though even then we had our problems, Bea and I.\u201d He declined to elaborate, stating only that they seemed minor in comparison. Gemma was 15 years younger than Nigel. For several months, they had pursued an active sex life\u2014\u201csomething else she organized.\u201d At the office, he had appreciated the way she managed his schedule. \u201cAt home, not so much.\u201d In the last 6 months, when she approached him for sex, he usually fobbed her off with the excuse that he was too tired or preoccupied. On the few occasions she could persuade him to try, he couldn\u2019t maintain an erection long enough to achieve penetration. The one time they did have intercourse, his attention had \u201cwandered off to the office,\u201d and he withdrew before either of them climaxed. Nigel\u2019s internist had checked his testosterone level, which was within normal range. On his second visit, Gemma tagged along. She and Nigel agreed that they drank little and had never used drugs or tobacco. Gemma added that a few months earlier, in desperation, she had subscribed to Playboy for him. \u201cHe\u2019s the only man I know who really does just read the articles,\u201d she commented. Nigel hadn\u2019t seen other women; he didn\u2019t even masturbate. \u201cFor months, the maga- zine\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve put to bed. I don\u2019t even have randy fantasies any more.\u201d The issue didn\u2019t distress Nigel for himself (\u201cIt\u2019s just not something I ever think about!\u201d), but he became almost tearful as he talked about how deeply he cared for Gemma, how he longed that she be happy\u2014that she not abandon him for someone else. One session when Nigel was in the room, Gemma explained, \u201cBesides books and magazines, our company makes films, mostly about love and lovemaking. Nigel thinks that\u2019s a total irony, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve finished shooting yet.\u201d Evaluation of Nigel O\u2019Neil Nigel\u2019s history is loaded with indicators of a persistent sexual disorder, including mul- tiple failures of his erection,",

Nigel thinks that\u2019s a total irony, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve finished shooting yet.\u201d Evaluation of Nigel O\u2019Neil Nigel\u2019s history is loaded with indicators of a persistent sexual disorder, including mul- tiple failures of his erection, his interest, his response (to invitations from Gemma), and even his fantasy life (criterion A). His interest in work was good and he denied feeling depressed, so a mood disorder seems unlikely (D), but a thorough review to identify any possible anxiety disorder would seem a good idea. The history appears to rule out an etiological role for drugs or alcohol (also D); there wasn\u2019t any apparent relationship distress\u2014yet, at any rate. The duration met the 6-month requirement (B), and Nigel\u2019s distress was palpable (C). In addition, Nigel would probably qualify for the diagnosis of erectile disorder. If so, it should also be made (other sexual disorders can coexist with MHSDD). It\u2019s just one more issue he and his clinician would need to explore. 354 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS Once the principal diagnosis was nailed down, the clinician\u2019s real work would begin\u2014 examining the possible causes of Nigel\u2019s lack of sexual interest. Each of these could indicate a therapeutic avenue to explore. Multiple possible contributing factors must be considered: Relationship factors\u2014did Nigel resent Gemma\u2019s overmanagement of their lives? Medical factors\u2014did Nigel have, say, diabetes or a cardiovascular condition? (If medical factors were the exclusive cause of Nigel\u2019s current sexual problems, we wouldn\u2019t make this diagnosis at all; see criterion D.) Cultural/religious concerns\u2014sex with Gemma while Nigel was still married to Bea could play a role. Though there\u2019s no information for partner factors or for any individual vulnerabil- ity factors such as depression, further exploratory interviews of both Nigel and Gemma would clearly be in order. Nigel\u2019s still unelaborated sexual problems with Bea even make us wonder whether his problem could have been lifelong, rather than acquired. Had his sex interest been on the low side with her, too? Had she complained? Did he fantasize about other women? Men? How affectionate were they as a couple? In its bare-bones form, Nigel\u2019s diagnosis would read as given below, but there\u2019s much more work to be done. Despite his difficulties with sex, I\u2019d put his GAF score at a relatively healthy 70.

Despite his difficulties with sex, I\u2019d put his GAF score at a relatively healthy 70. F52.0 [302.71] Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, acquired, generalized, severe F52.21 [302.72] Erectile Disorder Erectile disorder (ED), otherwise known as impotence, can be partial or complete. In either case, the erection is inadequate for satisfactory sex. Impotence can also be situ - ational, in which case the patient can achieve an erection only under certain circum - stances (for example, with prostitutes). ED is probably the most prevalent male sexual disorder, occurring at least occasionally in perhaps 2% of young men; that number does not improve with age. Of all the sexual dysfunctions, this is the one most likely to occur for the first time later in life. A variety of emotions can play a role in the development or maintenance of ED. These include fear, anxiety, anger, guilt, and distrust of the sexual partner. Any of these feelings can so preoccupy a man\u2019s attention that he cannot focus adequately on feeling sexual pleasure. Even a single failure may lead to anticipatory anxiety, which then precipitates another round in the circle of failure. The prominent sex research - ers Masters and Johnson also talked about a factor they called spectatoring , in which the patient evaluates his performance so constantly that he cannot concentrate on the Erectile Disorder 355 enjoyment of sex. Such a patient might have an erection with foreplay but lose it upon penetration. ED should not be diagnosed if biological factors are the principal or only cause. This is unlikely if erections occur spontaneously, with masturbation, or with other part- ners. Some authorities now estimate that half or more of patients who complain of impotence have a biological cause for it, such as prostatectomy for cancer. When psy - chological factors are judged to be a part of the cause, as is often the case, the diagnosis can be made. Like the other sexual dysfunctions, ED can be either lifelong or acquired; the former is rare and hard to treat. Essential Features of Erectile Disorder The patient almost always has marked trouble achieving or maintaining an erection adequate to consummate sex.

At age 45 he had been a bridegroom for only 7 months, and he was afraid he was losing his sexual potency. Everything had been fine before the wedding, but the first evening of their honey- moon, Parker had been unable to get enough of an erection to do either him or his wife much good. He supposed he\u2019d had too much champagne\u2014 normally he didn\u2019t touch alcohol. His wife had also been married before and knew a thing or two about men. She hadn\u2019t criticized; she\u2019d even said it would be all right. But she was attractive and 10 years younger than Parker, and he was worried: Most of the time since, he\u2019d been unable to perform. 356 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS \u201cSome of the guys warned me, it\u2019s what happens when you get older,\u201d Parker insisted. \u201cThat which should be easy is hard, and that which should be hard isn\u2019t.\u201d Before he popped the question, he had undergone a complete physical examina - tion. Other than being a few pounds overweight\u2014 Parker was devoted to chocolate ice cream\u2014he was given a clean bill of health. Besides the ice cream, he denied any other addictions, including alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. \u201cI get so nervous when it\u2019s time to make love,\u201d Parker explained. \u201cI can get a pretty good erection when we\u2019re fooling around, but when it\u2019s time to get serious, I lose it.

    "something of a stud, and I keep wondering how my performance measures up to his.\u201d Evaluation of Parker Flynn Parker\u2019s interest in sex seemed to be just fine; he gave every indication (normal erec - tions) that there was nothing wrong with the excitatory phase. But because he worried about maintaining his erection, he did have difficulty maintaining an erection (criterion A2) stressful enough that he sought care (C). His problem was exacerbated by the phe- nomenon of spectatoring (see above), in which his performance was affected by won - dering how well he was doing while he was doing it. His problem had been present for 7 months\u2014just qualifying for the DSM-5 time requirement (B, though in obvious cases I\u2019d be a little relaxed about this requirement; it does say \u201capproximately,\u201d after all). Parker\u2019s physical condition was good, pretty much ruling out a causative physical illness (D). Some patients with impotence may suffer from sleep apnea; of course, it is vital to explore this possibility, because of the potentially lethal nature of that disorder. He had no previous mental health problems that would preclude the diagnosis of ED. His difficulty may have begun with an alcohol- related incident, but from his history, substance use played no role in its maintenance. Also note that, as they age, men may require more stimulation to achieve erection than they did when they were younger; such a physiological change should not constitute evidence of ED. Sporadic erectile problems that don\u2019t cause important distress also should not be given this diagnosis. Parker\u2019s problem was not lifelong but acquired; the vignette provides no evidence that it applied only in specific situations, so neither situational nor generalized type would be specified. With no other obvious specifiers to note (and a GAF score of 70), his diagnosis would read: F52.21 [302.72] Erectile disorder, acquired F52.4 [302.75] Premature (Early) Ejaculation As the disorder\u2019s name implies, the man climaxes before he wants to\u2014 sometimes just as he and his partner reach the point of insertion. However, different studies use widely varying standards of how many minutes actually constitutes early: Is it 7 minutes? Is it 1? Both standards have been proposed. Whatever the duration, the climax yields dis - Premature (Early) Ejaculation 357 appointment and a sense of failure for both partners; secondary impotence sometimes follows.

    "Is it 7 minutes? Is it 1? Both standards have been proposed. Whatever the duration, the climax yields dis - Premature (Early) Ejaculation 357 appointment and a sense of failure for both partners; secondary impotence sometimes follows. Stress in a relationship can exacerbate the condition, which of course promotes even greater loss of control. However, some women may value premature ejaculation (PE) because it decreases their exposure to unwanted sexual activity or pregnancy. PE is a commonplace disorder; it accounts for nearly half the men treated for sexual disorders. It is especially frequent among men with more education\u2014 presumably because their social group is especially sensitive to the issue of partner satisfaction. Whereas anxi- ety is often a factor, physical illness or abnormalities rarely cause this problem. Essential Features of Premature (Early) Ejaculation The patient almost always ejaculates before he wants to, within moments of pen - etration. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (6+ months) \u2022 Distress to the patient \u2022 Differential diagnosis (sub- stance use and physical disorders) Coding Notes Specify: {Lifelong}{Acquired} {Generalized}{Situational} Specify severity: Mild. The patient ejaculates 30\u201360 seconds after penetration. Moderate. 15\u201330 seconds after penetration. Severe. 15 seconds after penetration or less (perhaps before penetration). Let\u2019s be practical. and honest. The official criteria state two time standards for the patient with premature ejaculation, which boil down to \u201cabout a minute\u201d and \u201ctoo early.\u201d DSM-5 claims that men can pretty accurately estimate time as long as it\u2019s a minute or less, and in the heat of the moment, it seems unlikely in the extreme that anyone is going to clap a stopwatch on the activity. Therefore, for the vast majority of our patients, we will eschew the clock and accept the statement that \u201cI just flat-out come too soon.\u201d Claude Campbell Claude Campbell could remember, in embarrassing detail, the first time it ever hap - pened. He had been a very young Marine second lieutenant stationed in Vietnam in the 358 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS last year of the war. Suddenly granted leave to go to town, he had had to borrow a pair of Class A uniform trousers from the battalion chaplain. Claude and two friends were seated at a sidewalk table, drinking a mixture that the military called a \u201cBombs Away,\u201d when a prostitute sat down next to him.

    "uniform trousers from the battalion chaplain. Claude and two friends were seated at a sidewalk table, drinking a mixture that the military called a \u201cBombs Away,\u201d when a prostitute sat down next to him. When she set to work warming her hand between his thighs, it only took a few moments before Claude felt himself lose control. A crimson blush spread across his face as a stain dark- ened the front of the chaplain\u2019s khaki trousers. \u201cThat was one of the worst times, but it sure wasn\u2019t the last,\u201d said Claude. After he left the Marines, he finished college and got a job selling computers. He soon married a girl he had dated during high school. Their wedding night, and most of their other nights, were never quite the disaster of the Vietnam bar, but he could never last longer than a minute or so after insertion. \u201cNot that it bothered her,\u201d commented Claude ruefully. \u201cShe never enjoyed sex much, anyway. She was always glad to get it over with in a hurry. I know now why she insisted on \u2018saving it\u2019 for after we were married. She never wanted to spend it in the first place.\u201d Claude always hoped that his problems had been largely due to his first wife\u2019s prud- ery and disapproval, but several months into his new marriage, things hadn\u2019t improved much. \u201cShe\u2019s being very patient,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re both beginning to get desperate.\u201d Evaluation of Claude Campbell Claude\u2019s difficulty had been with him ever since his sex life began, and it occurred every time (criterion B). Although a few such incidents might be dismissed in a young- ster or in any man with a new partner, in a mature adult (we don\u2019t know Claude\u2019s age at evaluation) who has been in a lasting relationship with frequent sexual activity, it must be considered pathological (A). Claude\u2019s difficulty was clearly causing him distress (C); we\u2019d have to enquire further about substance use (D). As noted earlier, physical illness does not play a significant role in the development of PE. Claude\u2019s problem was not situational (it had occurred with both of his wives and with the prostitute). As far as we\u2019re aware, he\u2019d had it forever. I\u2019d place his GAF score at 70.

F52.4 [302.75] Premature ejaculation, generalized, lifelong, moderate F52.32 [302.74] Delayed Ejaculation Men with delayed ejaculation (DE) achieve erection without difficulty, but have prob- lems reaching orgasm. Some only take a long time; others may not be able to ejaculate into a partner at all. Prolonged friction may cause the partners of these patients to complain of soreness. Anxiety about performance may cause secondary impotence in the patients themselves. Even when it has been present lifelong, a man can usually ejaculate by masturbat- Delayed Ejaculation 359 ing (alone or with the help of his sex partner). The personalities of patients with lifelong DE have been described as rigid and puritanical; some seem to equate sex with sin. Or the disorder may be acquired from interpersonal difficulties, fear of pregnancy, or a partner\u2019s lack of sexual allure. DE is somewhat more common in patients with anxiety disorders. DE is probably uncommon. When men do have problems with delayed (or absent) climax, there is often a medical cause; examples include hyperglycemia, prostatectomy, abdominal aortic surgery, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and spinal cord tumors. Some men have a physical abnormality that, upon orgasm, causes semen to be expelled into the urinary bladder (retrograde ejaculation). Drugs like alphamethyldopa (an antihypertensive) and thioridazine (a neuroleptic), as well as alcohol, have also been implicated. If any of these factors is the sole cause, it cannot be regarded as an example of DE. The drug thioridazine, which can inhibit a man\u2019s ability to have orgasm, is sometimes used to treat patients with premature ejaculation (see the previous diagnosis). Essential Features of Delayed Ejaculation The man experiences pronounced delay or infrequency of climax.

    "They had been together for nearly a year, and they disagreed as to the extent of the problem. Rodney was frankly worried. It had always taken him a long time to have a climax, and now, after 40 minutes or so of vigorous intercourse, he sometimes found himself 360 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS wilting under pressure. Frannie was more sanguine. Her previous boyfriend had never been able to last longer than 5 minutes, and that often left her feeling frustrated. \u201cNow I almost always come more than once,\u201d she said with an air of satisfaction. Recently Rodney had been taking even longer, and she admitted that she was getting pretty sore. \u201cMaybe if we could get it back down to about half an hour,\u201d she suggested. Rodney\u2019s parents had reared him strictly. Throughout his childhood, he had attended parochial school, so that he was \u201cpretty clear on the concept of good versus evil.\u201d He admitted that he felt guilty that he and Frannie were living together without benefit of clergy, but she wasn\u2019t ready to take that step yet. She used to laugh and tell him that she wanted to \u201csave something for after the baby came.\u201d Before meeting Frannie, Rodney\u2019s only experience had been with two prostitutes he had encountered while he was in the Navy. It had taken him hardly any time at all with either of them. In fact, he felt that the one with the mouth had rather shortchanged him. \u201cThere sure wasn\u2019t any delay involved,\u201d he said. Neither had he experienced any particular problem masturbating, either when he was an adolescent or more recently when Frannie was gone on an extended business trip. Rodney had been referred by a urologist, who had found nothing physically wrong. The couple\u2019s only drinking was an occasional glass of white wine. At one time Rodney had occasionally used marijuana at parties, but Frannie was death on drugs, so he had given it up a year ago. Evaluation of Rodney Stensrud After apparently normal desire and excitation phases, Rodney always took an inordi - nately long time to reach climax (criterion A1). From the vignette, this does not appear to have been a lifelong problem, though it had now lasted for many months (B). The problem was causing him enough distress to seek help (C); already he seemed headed down the road to secondary impotence. Rodney\u2019s problem was situational; he had experienced",
    "From the vignette, this does not appear to have been a lifelong problem, though it had now lasted for many months (B). The problem was causing him enough distress to seek help (C); already he seemed headed down the road to secondary impotence. Rodney\u2019s problem was situational; he had experienced no ejaculatory delay when with a prostitute or when masturbating. His referring physician had noted no physical illnesses that might account for his disorder, and there was no significant substance use; with no evidence of any other mental disorder that might be diagnosed instead, we\u2019ve exhausted the possibilities of criterion D. His upbringing was puritanical, rein - forcing the impression that the basis of his disorder was psychological, not physical. Frannie\u2019s reaction to Rodney\u2019s disorder was perhaps somewhat atypical. Female partners sometimes complain of discomfort from prolonged intercourse necessary to achieve climax. Would the fact that Frannie found value in Rodney\u2019s disorder pres - ent a possible problem for therapy? When working with the couple, Rodney\u2019s clinician should keep this factor in mind\u2014along with the possibility that he could have an anxi- ety disorder. Rodney\u2019s GAF score would be about 70. His diagnosis would be as follows: F52.32 [302.74] Delayed ejaculation, acquired, situational, moderate Delayed Ejaculation 361 F52.22 [302.72] Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder Female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD) represents the fusion of two older diag- noses: hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual arousal disorder. DSM-5 has combined them for several reasons. Especially in women, there is a high overlap between desire and arousal; some authorities think of desire as just the cognitive com- ponent of arousal. Moreover, one phase doesn\u2019t always precede the other; their relation- ship really depends on the individual. And treating low desire also improves arousal. Sexual desire depends upon a number of factors, including the patient\u2019s inherent drive and self- esteem, previous sexual satisfaction, an available partner, and a good relationship with the partner in areas other than sex. Sexual desire may be suppressed by long abstinence. It may present as infrequent sexual activity, or as a perception that the partner is unattractive. Some patients actually become averse to sex, expressing loathing of any genital contact or of aspects of genital sexual contact. Lack of interest in sex is the most common complaint of women coming to treat - ment. About 30% of women ages 18\u201359 will admit to having a period of at least",
    "actually become averse to sex, expressing loathing of any genital contact or of aspects of genital sexual contact. Lack of interest in sex is the most common complaint of women coming to treat - ment. About 30% of women ages 18\u201359 will admit to having a period of at least several months when they\u2019ve lacked sexual desire. As a result, perhaps half feel distress, which can affect the individuals or their relationships. Low desire is greater for women who are postmenopausal (either naturally or after surgery). There may be a history of painful intercourse, feelings of guilt, or rape or other sexual trauma occurring in childhood or in a patient\u2019s earlier sexual life. Don\u2019t diagnose FSIAD if the problem occurs only in the context of another mental condition, such as major depressive disorder or a substance use disorder. (Among the medications that can contribute are antihistamines and anticholinergics.) Also note that postmenopausal females may need more foreplay to lubricate to the same degree than they did when they were younger. However, FSIAD often coexists with another sexual condition, such as female orgasmic disorder. A woman who doesn\u2019t express interest in sex but does respond to sexual activity with excitement would not qualify for a diagnosis of FSIAD. Neither would someone who identifies herself as having been \u201casexual\u201d her whole life. Essential Features of Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder A woman\u2019s low sexual interest or arousal is indicated by minimal interest in sexual activity, erotic thoughts, response to partner overtures, and enjoyment during sex. She will generally not initiate sexual activity and doesn\u2019t \u201cturn on\u201d to erotic litera - ture, movies, and the like.

For the first few months, Ernestine would simply lie still and think about other things, enduring what was for her a basically boring activity because it was important to her new husband. Her gynecologist had assured her that as far as her anatomy and hormones were concerned, she was completely normal. Unless she was figuring out whether it was time to start taking her new prescription of birth control pills, she never thought about sex. \u201cGod knows, I never dream about it,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cMaybe if he\u2019d led up to it more, it would have helped. His idea of foreplay is half an hour of David Letterman and a slap on the butt.\u201d She had once tried to explain this to James, but he had only called her \u201cfrigid.\u201d That was the last word they had exchanged on the subject until now. Now James pretty much ignored Ernestine. She undressed in the closet; they slept on the two edges of their king-sized bed. She didn\u2019t know where he was getting his sex these days, but it wasn\u2019t at home and she said she didn\u2019t care. \u201cAt least he doesn\u2019t have to worry that I\u2019d try to cut it off, like that Bobbitt woman,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cI don\u2019t even like to look at it, let alone touch it with a 10-inch knife.\u201d Evaluation of Ernestine Paget Ernestine\u2019s low sex interest was shown not just by absent interest (criterion A1); she denied even fantasizing (A2) about what was for her a boring activity (A4). This is an important point: Some patients may reject the idea of sex with a current (or with any) Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder 363 partner, yet may still harbor an abstract interest in sex or in sex",
    "denied even fantasizing (A2) about what was for her a boring activity (A4). This is an important point: Some patients may reject the idea of sex with a current (or with any) Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder 363 partner, yet may still harbor an abstract interest in sex or in sex with some hypothetical person. When Ernestine began her sexual life with her husband 3 years earlier (B), she was merely uninterested in sex. It was only with experience that she became intoler - ant of the very idea of sexual contact, from which we can infer criterion A3. (Three of the six criterion A requirements for FSIAD must be met.) Although she could face the prospect of no sex with equanimity, her husband couldn\u2019t, and that disparity was caus- ing distress for them both; criterion C was thus satisfied. Ernestine\u2019s clinician needed to ascertain that she had no other major disor - der\u2014such as major depressive disorder , somatic symptom disorder , or obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder\u2014that could explain her antipathy to sex (D). In the presence of any of these, she\u2019d only receive the additional diagnosis of FSIAD if her sexual symp - toms remained once the other pathology had been eliminated. Similar arguments would hold for substance use or another medical condition. The Pagets were also having severe problems with other aspects of their mar - riage\u2014enough to warrant mention as a spousal relationship problem. Her abhorrence of sexual contact could also meet the criteria for specific phobia ; under the circum - stances, however, no such additional diagnosis is necessary. In DSM-IV, Ernestine would have qualified for a diagnosis of sexual aversion disorder, but DSM-5 has elimi- nated it. Ernestine\u2019s condition appears to have lasted throughout her sexual life. With our current information, we couldn\u2019t determine whether her disorder was generalized or situational. Although we suspect that something in her upbringing may lie at its roots, in DSM-5 we have no way to code this putative etiology. With a current GAF score of 61, her diagnosis would be as follows: F52.22 [302.72] Female sexual interest/arousal disorder, lifelong, severe Z63.0 [V61.10] Relationship distress with husband (emotional withdrawal) Disorders of female sexual arousal and orgasm are often highly correlated. a mong health care clinicians, you may encounter less than slavish adherence to the criteria used for these disorders.

F52.6 [302.76] Genito- Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder Genito- pelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPD), new in DSM-5, subsumes the DSM-IV categories of dyspareunia and vaginismus, which were combined because they couldn\u2019t be discriminated reliably. The old terms will probably retain some currency as descrip- tors of particular types of discomfort. Some women experience marked discomfort when attempting to have sexual inter- course. The pain may be experienced as a cramping contraction of the vaginal muscles (vaginismus) that may be described as an ache, a twinge, or a sharp pain. Anxiety can 364 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS produce tension in the pelvic floor, with resulting pain severe enough to prevent con - summation of a relationship (sometimes for years). Soon anxiety comes to replace sexual enjoyment. Some patients can\u2019t even use a tampon; a vaginal exam may require anes - thesia. Nearly a third of women who have had gynecological surgery will experience some degree of pain with intercourse. Infections, scars, and pelvic inflammatory disease have also been reported as causes. Don\u2019t diagnose GPD when pain is only a symptom of another medical condition or is due to substance misuse. What percentage of women will qualify for GPD remains unknown. Two examples of this somewhat clumsily named condition follow. Essential Features of Genito- Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder A patient has major, repeated pain or other problems with efforts at vaginal inter - course; she may experience anxiety, fear, or pelvic muscle tension.

It\u2019s awful! Even if I use Vaseline, it still bothers me.\u201d The referral letter noted that she\u2019d had surgery for a prolapsed uterus but was oth- erwise healthy. \u201cI could have told you that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never even been to a doctor, except to have my babies.\u201d On close questioning, Mildred admitted that the pain didn\u2019t occur often. But dur- Genito- Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder 365 ing the past year or two she had always been afraid it would hurt, and that made her invariably tense up when she was having intercourse with her husband. She\u2019d had some vaginal infections, but these had been largely under control during the last few months; the gynecologist didn\u2019t think that they caused the pain she complained of. The letter also noted that her physical exam had been completed easily, with no evidence of vagi- nal spasm. \u201cMaybe I do overreact,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least that\u2019s what my husband tells me. He says I\u2019m too excitable, that I should just relax.\u201d Evaluation of Mildred Frank Many women have sporadic pain with intercourse, in which case diagnosis is usually not warranted. But for a couple of years (criterion B) Mildred had experienced pain, tensing, and fear; each was enough to qualify her for the form of GPD that was once known as dyspareunia (A2, A4, A3). Her distress was evident (C); as ever, the real prob- lem is to rule out other causes first. Mildred described herself as otherwise healthy, and her gynecologist made no mention of other medical problems. Although she had had some vaginal infections, the doctor felt that they couldn\u2019t completely account for her pain. Her clinician would have to determine that there was no substance- induced disorder, though this would seem unlikely. Sexual dysfunctions can be expected with a number of mental conditions (anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders), but her history supports none of them as a possible cause. Painful intercourse famously occurs in patients with somatic symptom disorder, but Mildred claimed that she was otherwise healthy, which would greatly reduce the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Painful intercourse famously occurs in patients with somatic symptom disorder, but Mildred claimed that she was otherwise healthy, which would greatly reduce the likelihood of this diagnosis. All of the foregoing factors should lay to rest our concern about other causes (D). Although Mildred\u2019s pain with intercourse was acquired fairly recently and only occurred occasionally, it did cause her to seek treatment. She had had no partners other than her husband, though nothing in the vignette suggests that she would have fared better with someone else. Although insufficient symptoms were noted to warrant a personality disorder, her clinician should note in the chart any behaviors that seem to justify further investigation. I\u2019d give her GAF score as 71. F52.6 [302.76] Genito- pelvic pain/penetration disorder, acquired, mild to moderate In men, the symptom of painful intercourse is rare and almost always associated with some physical illnesses, such as Peyronie\u2019s disease (a lateral bend in an erect penis), prostatitis, or infections (for example, gonorrhea and herpes). It can cause an inability to complete penetration during sex\u2014or fear that pain will occur. However, at least one study has reported that, contrary to expectation, men with a pelvic pain syndrome experience minimal impact on their interpersonal relationships; indeed, pain levels and good relation- 366 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS ship adjustment were directly proportional. Such a situation would obviate a diagnosis of GPD, even if DSM-5 had been disposed to allow it in a man. Maxine Whalen Maxine Whalen and her twin sister, Mildred Frank (see preceding vignette), had both been having problems with pain during intercourse; as noted above, they made a joint decision to seek help. Finding no anatomical causes for either of them, the gynecologist had referred both to the mental health clinic. Maxine wasn\u2019t married yet, and she didn\u2019t think she wanted to be. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t get horny,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I love foreplay. I could do it all night. But every time a man has tried to enter me, something inside me clamps down like a trap. I couldn\u2019t even get a pencil inside, let alone a penis. I can\u2019t even use a tampon.\u201d Maxine usually relieved her frustration by masturbating, which reliably produced a climax. Oral sex had also worked. \u201cNot many men are likely to be satisfied with that for long,\u201d she remarked. \u201cIt makes me feel",
    "even get a pencil inside, let alone a penis. I can\u2019t even use a tampon.\u201d Maxine usually relieved her frustration by masturbating, which reliably produced a climax. Oral sex had also worked. \u201cNot many men are likely to be satisfied with that for long,\u201d she remarked. \u201cIt makes me feel like a freak.\u201d The spasms that contracted Maxine\u2019s vaginal muscles produced severe, cramping pain. They were so extreme that her gynecologist had to insert the speculum under general anesthesia. The exam revealed no physical abnormalities. On her second visit, Maxine remembered something that Mildred apparently hadn\u2019t known. When the girls were 4, they had been molested in some way. Even Maxine wasn\u2019t sure exactly what had happened. She only knew that some man\u2014she thought it might be the Uncle Max for whom she had been named\u2014had taken the girls to a tavern, stood them on the bar, and allowed the other patrons to \u201cplay\u201d with them. Evaluation of Maxine Whalen Maxine\u2019s lifelong (criterion B) history of severe pain and obstructed penetration (A1, A2\u2014only one required) suggests the diagnosis. The fact that the spasm was repro - duced by the attempted introduction of the gynecologist\u2019s speculum was diagnostic. Unless a patient is both unattached and content to refrain from intercourse, it is axiom- atic that vaginal spasms will produce distress or interpersonal difficulty (C). Maxine\u2019s history did not indicate that there had ever been a time since she became sexually active when she was free of vaginal spasm (B); therefore, we\u2019d call it lifelong. It also occurred in a variety of contexts, so it was generalized rather than situational. Her gynecologist found no physical cause (no surprise there, since none are usually reported\u2014D). Her GAF score would be 65. In DSM-IV-TR, Maxine\u2019s diagnosis would have been vaginismus. F52.6 [302.76] Genito- pelvic pain/penetration disorder, lifelong, generalized, severe Genito- Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder 367 F52.31 [302.73] Female Orgasmic Disorder Achieving climax is a problem for a lot of women, though studies have been persistently inconsistent as to just what that means. Perhaps 30% of women report significant dif - ficulties; 10% never learn the trick. A few physical illnesses, including hypothyroid - ism, diabetes, and structural damage to the vagina, can contribute to the condition; if judged to be exclusively the cause, they obviate the diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder (FOD).

    "trick. A few physical illnesses, including hypothyroid - ism, diabetes, and structural damage to the vagina, can contribute to the condition; if judged to be exclusively the cause, they obviate the diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder (FOD). Orgasm can also be inhibited by medications such as antihyperten - sives, central nervous system stimulants, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxi- dase inhibitors. Possible psychological factors include fear of pregnancy, hostility of the patient toward her partner, and feeling guilty about sex in general. Age, previous sexual experience, and the adequacy of foreplay must also be considered in diagnosing FOD. Once learned, a woman\u2019s ability to achieve orgasm persists, often improving throughout life. But women just don\u2019t complain of having premature orgasms, the way men do. Although it occurs (shown by surveys), it often doesn\u2019t pose a problem. Many women are able to enjoy sex without experiencing climax on a frequent basis. FOD is often comorbid with other sexual dysfunctions, especially female sexual interest/ arousal disorder. Essential Features of Female Orgasmic Disorder A woman has been troubled by orgasms that are too slow, too rare, or too weak.

Beginning when she was in middle school, a series of stepfathers had molested Rachel until, when she was 16, she\u2019d bolted\u2014into prostitution. \u201cHow ironic is that, escaping from sex by going on the game?\u201d she asked. But she was lucky enough to avoid AIDS and, when she was 22, smart enough to jump at a chance at college, financed by a conscience- stricken former client.

Only it never was.\u201d Now a university graduate solidly planted in the academic world (she taught anthropology at a college in her community), Rachel was nearing 30 and had a boy - friend who wanted to marry her. \u201cHe knows all about my past, and he\u2019s OK with it. But he wants me to come when we have sex. I think it would reassure him that he\u2019s different from all those others. I desperately want to please him, but there\u2019s just something miss- ing in me. It\u2019s beyond distressing!\u201d Rachel loved the closeness she felt with Henry, and she lubricated well. \u201cI just never quite get over the top. It\u2019s like when you think you\u2019re going to sneeze, you know? And instead, it just dissolves in your nose.\u201d She\u2019d tried mood music, alcohol, marijuana, erotic literature, and clitoral stimulation. \u201cBut I could be digging pottery shards, for all the good any of it does.\u201d Apart from the usual teenage experimentation and the brief \u201ctherapeutic\u201d flirta - tion with white wine and marijuana, Rachel had used no drugs. Her general health was excellent, she said. \u201cI promised Henry I\u2019d always be truthful with him, and I intend to keep that promise. So I refuse to fake it. I could, though\u2014I\u2019ve sure had practice!\u201d Just why women have orgasms isn\u2019t actually known. Of course, the reason for the male counterpart is obvious: Its absence would leave us bereft of males or females. One of the more popular theories is that it developed in parallel with the male orgasm, and there\u2019s just been no evolutionary pressure for it to go away. The author of that theory must have been a guy.

Her difficulty was solely her inabil- ity to climax\u2014ever (criterion B). If she had had occasional orgasms, or if she climaxed only with masturbation, she could still receive this diagnosis, according to DSM-5\u2019s Female Orgasmic Disorder 369 criterion A1; low intensity of orgasm would also qualify (A2). There was no evidence that other medical or mental conditions or substance use contributed in the slightest (D). What she did have in abundance was distress (C). Because she\u2019d never experienced a climax, we should add that verbiage to her diagnosis (which obviates the other possible specifiers). Her GAF score would be rated very high (95) for any patient, because of her overall excellent adjustment. I would rate the severity of her FOD as only moderate, largely because of the composure and well- balanced approach to her life she showed during the discussion with her clinician. F52.31 [302.73] Female orgasmic disorder, never experienced an orgasm under any situation, moderate Substance/Medication- Induced Sexual Dysfunction As with physical illness, a variety of psychoactive substances can affect the sexual abili- ties of men and women. Note that you would substitute the diagnosis of substance/ medication- induced sexual dysfunction for a specific substance intoxication diagnosis only when the patient\u2019s problems in that area exceed those you would expect in the usual course of substance intoxication. On average, perhaps half of patients taking antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs will report sexual side effects, though these will not always reach the level of clinical significance. Users of street drugs also often have sexual side effects, though they may complain less, since they may value their drug of choice more highly than sex. The vast number of possible expressions has persuaded me not to include a vignette for this section. Essential Features of Substance/Medication- Induced Sexual Dysfunction Substance use appears to have caused sexual dysfunction.

Primary Gender Dysphoria Gender dysphoria in adolescents or adults. Patients strongly identify with the gender other than their own assigned gender role, with which they are uncomfortable. Some request sex reassignment surgery to relieve this discomfort (p. 372). Gender dysphoria in children. Children as young as 3 or 4 years can be dissatisfied with their assigned gender (p. 374). Other specified, or unspecified, gender dysphoria. Use one of these categories for gender dysphoria symptoms that do not meet full diagnostic criteria (p. 377).

Some patients with schizophrenia will express the delusion of being the other gender (p. 64). Transvestic disorder. These people have sexual urges related to cross- dressing, but do not wish to be of the other gender (p. 583). F64.1 [302.85] Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults Adult patients with gender dysphoria (GD) feel intensely uncomfortable with their own assigned gender (sometimes called natal gender). Some actually detest their own geni- talia. They wish to live as members of the other gender, and many of them do adopt opposite- gender dress and mannerisms. Cross- dressing (though not for sexual stimula- tion) is a common first step toward a complete gender change. Next, they may request to take hormones to stop menstruation, enlarge their breasts, suppress male character- istics, or otherwise change their body appearance or functioning. A few persons with GD feel so uncomfortable with their nominal, assigned gender that they request hormone treatment or reassignment surgery. Although many patients who have such surgery are reportedly satisfied and live contentedly in their new gen - der, some ultimately request to change back. A few genetic males retain their genitals but have their breasts augmented chemically or through surgery. GD, popularly still referred to as transsexualism (though far from all patients with GD desire sex reassignment measures), is one of the more recently described disorders in DSM-5. Until the 1950s, clinicians did not even recognize the existence of people with GD. It was through the widespread publicity that occurred in 1952, after Christine Jorgensen received sex reassignment surgeries in Denmark and emerged as a woman, that this disorder became generally acknowledged. Even now, GD is relatively infre - quent (around 1% for natal males and perhaps one-third that for females). It begins in early childhood (typically, preschool) and appears to be chronic. Causation isn\u2019t known for sure. However, there is evidence support at least a weak genetic component. Many natal males with GD have low sex drive; if they engage in sex at all, most prefer men. Nearly all affected women are sexually attracted to women. Posttransition Specifier The posttransition specifier indicates that the patient now lives exclusively as a person of the desired gender and has undergone (or is undergoing) one or more cross-sex medi- cal procedures. These would include regimens such as regular",

Posttransition Specifier The posttransition specifier indicates that the patient now lives exclusively as a person of the desired gender and has undergone (or is undergoing) one or more cross-sex medi- cal procedures. These would include regimens such as regular cross-sex hormone treat- ments and gender reassignment surgery to the desired gender. Surgery would entail orchiectomy, penectomy, and vaginoplasty in a genetic male, mastectomy and phal - loplasty in a genetic female. army Private First c lass bradley Manning was convicted in 2013 of the WikiLeaks publi- cation of 700,000 documents. The day after he was sentenced to 35 years in prison, he announced that he wanted hormone therapy and wished to live the rest of his life as a female, chelsea Manning. Michelle Kosilek has languished for the past 20 years in a Massachusetts prison, sentenced for killing her wife during a domestic dispute (despite nearly life-long gender dysphoric issues, when married, Michelle still occupied her natal gender). Five specialists have recommended sex change surgery. The lives of these two people highlight how far we have come in recognizing this fraught condition, and how far we have yet to go. Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults 373 F64.2 [302.6] Gender Dysphoria in Children In the general population, a small percentage of boys (1\u20132%)\u2014and a smaller still per - centage of girls\u2014want to be of the other gender. It\u2019s mainly boys who are ever referred for clinical evaluation, probably because parents worry more about an effeminate son than about a tomboy daughter. Although cross- gender behaviors often begin by age 3, the typical child isn\u2019t referred until years later. Exactly what behaviors are we talking about? From a very young age, these chil - dren know they are different. Boys prefer playing with dolls, assuming a female role in play, cross- dressing, and especially associating with a peer group of girls. Girls with GD take the male role in family games and strongly reject female activities such as playing with dolls. Of course, all such children, boys particularly, risk teasing, bully - ing, and other forms of peer rejection. The 2011 book Transition , which describes the childhood struggle with his own gender identity, recounts Chaz (n\u00e9e Chastity) Bono\u2019s anguish when the development of breasts and onset of menses during puberty caused both physical and emotional torment.

The 2011 book Transition , which describes the childhood struggle with his own gender identity, recounts Chaz (n\u00e9e Chastity) Bono\u2019s anguish when the development of breasts and onset of menses during puberty caused both physical and emotional torment. Of course, GD isn\u2019t the only possible explanation for behavior that is \u201cdifferent\u201d: some boys just don\u2019t like sports or rough games, and some girls, perceiving social advantages in being male, prefer boys\u2019 clothing. And, sure enough, follow-up stud - ies of children who had been clinically referred for GD behavior find that, by their late teenage years, most will no longer qualify for a formal diagnosis. On average, those who still are affected ( persisters, as they are sometimes termed) had had as children a greater degree of GD. Girls are somewhat more likely than boys to remain dysphoric. It is far more common for boys with GD to grow up to become gay men than to have GD; a minority become normally heterosexual; perhaps a few have GD as adults (though the studies vary tremendously as regards percentage). The rate of persisters among natal females is higher, but still well under 50%. Ultimate diagnosis in children or adolescents may require prolonged evaluation. The case vignette of Billie Worth below contains a lot of information that illus - trates GD, both in children and in adults. Essential Features of Gender Dysphoria In Adolescents or Adults There is a marked disparity between nominal (natal) gender and what the patient experiences as a sense of self. This can be expressed as a rejection or wish not to have one\u2019s own sex characteristics or to have those of the other gender. The patient might also express the desire to belong to the other gender and to be treated as though that were the case. Some patients believe that their responses are typical of the other gender. 374 GENDEr DYSPHOrIA In Children The characteristics of GD in children are similar to those in adults, but manifest themselves in age- appropriate ways. So, in their powerful longing to be the oppo - site gender, kids may insist that\u2019s what they are ; they prefer clothing, toys, games, playmates, and fantasy roles of the other gender while rejecting their own; and they may say that they hate their own genitalia and want that which they don\u2019t have.

    "to be the oppo - site gender, kids may insist that\u2019s what they are ; they prefer clothing, toys, games, playmates, and fantasy roles of the other gender while rejecting their own; and they may say that they hate their own genitalia and want that which they don\u2019t have. Note that in children, the number of criteria required (six out of eight) is far greater than for adults (two of six); this is a protective device for persons who have not yet fully matured. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (6+ months, regardless of age) \u2022 Distress or disability (work/edu- cational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders, psychotic disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, and [in adoles - cents/adults] transvestic disorder) Coding Notes Specify if: With a disorder of sex development (and code the actual congenital develop - mental disorder) Posttransition (for adolescents/adults). The patient is living in the desired gen - der and has had at least one cross- gender surgical procedure or medical treatment (such as a hormone regimen). The addition of the posttransition specifier addresses the fact that patients who have undergone procedures to achieve their desired gender will no longer meet the criteria for GD; yet they continue to pursue psychotherapy, hormonal treatment, or other remedies for the condition with which they were once diagnosed. Billie Worth \u201cI just want to get rid of it. All of it.\u201d For the third time that day, Billie Worth explained his feelings. He wasn\u2019t depressed or melodramatic. Patiently, quietly, he stated the facts. One of his earliest memories was of watching an actress on TV. When she walked, she brushed her hand against her skirt, so it appeared to dance. He had tried to imi - tate that walk, to the delight and applause of his mother. His father had for years been imprisoned for forgery. When he was 6, Billie discovered that playing with cap pistols and spaceships like Gender Dysphoria in Children 375 the other boys gave him a violent headache. He preferred a Barbie doll that another child had discarded in a dumpster, and he chose his playmates, insofar as he was able, from neighborhood girls who were his age. When playing house, he would insist that one of them be \u201cthe dad.\u201d When he was a baby, his 6-year-old sister, Marsha, had died of meningitis. Billie\u2019s mother had kept Marsha\u2019s",

When playing house, he would insist that one of them be \u201cthe dad.\u201d When he was a baby, his 6-year-old sister, Marsha, had died of meningitis. Billie\u2019s mother had kept Marsha\u2019s room just as it had been when she died. Some of his happiest childhood afternoons were spent donning Marsha\u2019s dresses and sitting on her bed with Barbie. Sometimes, wishing he were a girl, he pretended to be Marsha. He continued to wedge his feet into her black patent leather shoes until long after he had grown too big for them. In his early teens, about the age that adolescents begin to think seriously about themselves, he realized that in fact he was a girl. \u201cIt suddenly struck me that the only masculine thing about me was these revolting things between my legs,\u201d he much later told one of his clinicians. Claiming to have chronic asthma, he persuaded a physician to excuse him from gym class throughout his 4 years of high school. Although he was a good swimmer, his abhorrence of the locker room prevented him from trying out for the team. He took shorthand and home economics (four semesters of each). He did join the science club, which was about as asexual a club as he could find. One year he entered a project in the science fair on the use of various yeasts in baking bread. When Billie was 16, he bought his first bra and panties with money he had earned babysitting. When he put them on for the first time, he could feel some of the tension drain out of him. Although he sometimes wore his lingerie to school, he didn\u2019t begin cross- dressing in earnest until he started college. Because he lived off campus, he had the privacy in which to experiment with skirts, blouses, and makeup. A sympathetic physician provided him with estrogens, and in his junior year he changed the spelling of his name and began to live as a woman. Two years out of college, Billie requested sex reassignment surgery. She had had several gay male lovers\u2014 unsatisfying experiences, because she did not consider herself to be homosexual. \u201cI\u2019m not a gay man; I feel that I\u2019m a straight woman.\u201d By now, thanks to hormones, she had small though well- developed breasts;",

Evaluation of Billie Worth Billie\u2019s early realization that he somehow didn\u2019t fit in with the other boys is typical of children with GD. He showed this by several sorts of behaviors, which constitute the principal childhood indicators of this diagnosis when it is made in children: Pretending to be Marsha, he wished he were a girl (criterion A1). He preferred wearing his sister\u2019s dress and shoes (A2). Preferring a cross- gender role for himself, he assigned girls to play the dad (A3) He rejected boys\u2019 games (A6) and preferred girls\u2019 play (A4), and he preferred playing with girls (A5). As an adult, he met several of the DSM-5 symptomatic criteria. He voiced a pro - 376 GENDEr DYSPHOrIA found incongruence between his natal and preferred gender (A1), a desire to be a woman (A4) and be rid of his genitalia (A2), a wish to have breasts and a vagina (A3), and the conviction that he had the characteristics of a straight woman (A6). He needed only two of these to fulfill the DSM-5 criteria. Billie\u2019s full realization that he had been born the wrong sex didn\u2019t come until ado- lescence. At about that time, he began a progression\u2014first dressing as a female, then living as a female and taking hormones\u2014 culminating in the request for sex reassign - ment surgery. Although the vignette does not specify that no intersex condition was present, neither does it contain any information that would suggest such a condition. (Not that it matters: DSM-5 allows patients with a disorder of sex development to be diagnosed with GD. Such a person would receive an additional specifier.) Throughout his childhood, adolescence, and into his adult life, Billie\u2019s distress was way beyond \u201cclinical significance.\u201d The differential diagnosis of GD includes schizophrenia, in which the patient may occasionally have delusions of being the opposite sex.

    "additional specifier.) Throughout his childhood, adolescence, and into his adult life, Billie\u2019s distress was way beyond \u201cclinical significance.\u201d The differential diagnosis of GD includes schizophrenia, in which the patient may occasionally have delusions of being the opposite sex. Billie showed no evidence of delusions, hallucinations, or any other typical symptoms. The absence of sexual excite- ment as a reaction to cross- dressing would rule out transvestic disorder, though some patients with GD initially have this paraphilia. Many (perhaps most) patients with GD also have an associated personality disorder, such as borderline or narcissistic personality disorder. (This may be less often true of natal female patients with GD.) No evidence of any personality disorder is presented in the vignette, though Billie\u2019s clinician should search diligently for such pathology, which can strongly influence the management and outcome of this condition. A note in the summary would be an important reminder not to forget this step. As you might expect, anxiety and mood disorders are also common associated features. Use of substances (alcohol and/or street drugs) may also be a factor, especially in natal female patients. Billie\u2019s diagnosis at the time of evaluation (GAF score of 71) would read as follows: F64.1 [302.85] Gender dysphoria in an adult Had he been interviewed as a child, he would have fully met even the rather restrictive DSM-5 criteria for children: F64.2 [302.6] Gender dysphoria in children F64.8 [302.6] Other Specified Gender Dysphoria Here you could include a patient who has met GD criteria for less than the 6-month minimum.

Oppositional defiant disorder. Multiple examples of negativistic behavior persist for at least 6 months (p. 380). Intermittent explosive disorder. With no other demonstrable pathology (psychological or general medical), these patients have episodes during which they act out aggressively. As a result, they physically harm others or destroy property (p. 384). Kleptomania. An irresistible urge to steal things they don\u2019t need causes these patients to do so repeatedly. The phrase \u201ctension and release\u201d characterizes this behavior (p. 390). Pyromania. Fire setters feel \u201ctension and release\u201d in regard to the behavior of starting fires (p. 387). Antisocial personality disorder. The irresponsible, often criminal behavior of people with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) begins in childhood or early adolescence with truancy, running away, cruelty, fighting, destructiveness, lying, and theft. In addition to criminal behavior, as adults they may default on debts, or otherwise show irresponsibility; act reck- lessly or impulsively; and show no remorse for their behavior. DSM-5 actually includes ASPD in this chapter, though it gives the symptoms in detail with those of the other personality disorders (p. 541). Other specified, or unspecified, disruptive, impulse- control, and conduct disorder. Use one of these categories for disturbances of conduct or oppositional behaviors that do not meet the criteria for other disorders covered in this group (p. 392). Other Disorders Associated with Disruptive or Impulsive Behavior Trichotillomania (hair- pulling disorder). Pulling hair from various parts of the body is often accompanied by feelings of \u201ctension and release\u201d (p. 210). Paraphilic disorders. Some people (nearly always males) have recurrent sexual urges involv- ing a variety of behaviors that are objectionable to others. They may act upon these urges in order to obtain pleasure (p. 564). Substance- related disorders. There is often an impulsive component to the misuse of vari - ous substances (p. 396). Bipolar I disorder. Patients with bipolar I may steal, gamble, act out violently, and engage in other socially undesirable behaviors, though this happens only during an acute manic episode (p. 129). Schizophrenia.

This code (Z72.810 [V71.02]) can be useful when antisocial behavior in a young person cannot be ascribed to a mental disorder such as oppo- sitional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (p. 593). Adult antisocial behavior. This code (Z72.811 [V71.01]) is used to describe activities by an adult that are illegal, but do not occur in the context of mental disorder (p. 593). Introduction This section considers conditions that in other professions might elicit a value judgment of \u201cbad behavior.\u201d Fortunately, we have the luxury of not having to judge them; rather, Introduction 379 we can study them from the standpoints of understanding why they occur and learning how to ameliorate them. These disorders entail problems with the regulation of behavior and emotions. The behaviors in question may occur on the spur of the moment, or they may be planned; some are accompanied by efforts to resist. The acts themselves are often illegal, with consequent injury to the perpetrator or to others. Each disorder in its own way brings the patient into conflict with what we under- stand as social norms. In each, males predominate; all typically start in childhood or adolescence. Sometimes there is a progression\u2014for instance, from oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) to conduct disorder (CD) to ASPD. However, we must not draw the mistaken conclusion that having one foot on the pathway means eventual arrival at the end of the trail. In fact, the majority of patients with ODD do not go on to develop CD, just as most patients with CD do not progress to ASPD. Still, in an important minority of patients, there is that developmental arc. I usually put child diagnoses toward the end of each chapter. Here I\u2019m going to break my rule, in order to underscore the (occasional) march from one disorder to the next.

    "to underscore the (occasional) march from one disorder to the next. F91.3 [313.81] Oppositional Defiant Disorder ODD ushers in a triad of disorders spanning a spectrum of behavior from resistance that is barely outside the expected to acts that are execrable. ODD itself can be rela - tively mild, with symptoms of negativism and defiance that seem to grow out of any child\u2019s normal quest for independence. On the one hand, they are distinguished from normal opposition by severity and duration; on the other, they are distinguished from the more problematic CD by the fact that children with ODD don\u2019t violate the basic rights of others or age- appropriate societal rules. The symptoms of ODD first show up around age 3 or 4; diagnosis is typically made a few years later. Younger children will show oppositional behavior almost every day, whereas for older children the frequency tends to decline. The effects are worst at home, though relationships with teachers and peers can also be affected. Younger age and more severe symptoms at onset predict a worse outcome. DSM-5 does caution us to consider possible modifying factors such as developmental age, culture, and gender; it notes that symptoms must occur with people other than siblings. Though ODD runs in families, genetic relationships are not certain. Some authori- ties attribute ODD to discipline that is harsh and inconsistent, others to imitation of parental behavior. Low socioeconomic status may contribute through the stress of liv - ing at or near the poverty line. Along with CD, ODD is among the most common reasons for referral to mental health professionals. It affects about 3% of all children (boys predominate), with a broad range, depending on the study, of 1\u201316%. When it does occur in girls, its expression may be at once more verbal and less obvious; predictions made from its diagnosis may be less robust than for boys. 380 DISrUPTIVE, IMPULSE-CONTr OL, AND CONDUCT DISO rDErS Over half of those who initially meet ODD criteria will not do so several years later. However, CD will develop later in about a third of patients, especially those whose ODD begins early and coexists with attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; these diagnoses are strongly comorbid). Perhaps 10% will eventually be diag- nosed with ASPD. The irritable mood symptoms of ODD predict later anxiety and depression; defiance symptoms point toward CD.

The irritable mood symptoms of ODD predict later anxiety and depression; defiance symptoms point toward CD. ODD can be diagnosed in an adult, and sometimes it is: It has been reported in 12\u201350% of adults with ADHD. However, in adults the symptoms of ODD may be obscured by other disorders, or they may appear to constitute a personality disorder. Essential Features of Oppositional Defiant Disorder These patients are often angry and irritable, tending toward touchiness and hair- trigger temper. They will disobey authority figures or argue with them, and they may refuse to cooperate or follow rules\u2014if only to annoy. They sometimes accuse others of their own misdeeds; some appear malicious. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration and demographics (6+ months\u2014more or less daily for age 5 and under; weekly for older children) \u2022 Distress (patient or others) or disability (educa - tional/work, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use disorders, ADHD, psychotic or mood disorders, disruptive mood dysregulation disor- der, ordinary childhood growth and development) Coding Notes Specify severity: Mild. Symptoms occur in only 1 location (home, school, with friends). Moderate. Some symptoms in 2+ locations. Severe. Symptoms in 3+ locations. Conduct Disorder From as early as 2 years of age, boys normally display more aggressive behavior than do girls. Even beyond this, however, aggressive breaking of rules dominates the behav- ior of a substantial minority of children. For some patients, the symptoms of CD may represent only an extreme expression of normal efforts to differentiate themselves from their parents. But note that most CD symptoms, whether they occur in the juvenile years or later, are quite serious and can lead to arrest or other legal consequences. CD is defined in part by the degree to which a child\u2019s family, social, or scholastic life becomes affected by such behavior. That can happen as early as age 5 or 6. Conduct Disorder 381 DSM-5\u2019s 15 listed behaviors constitute four categories: (1) aggression, (2) destruc- tion, (3) lying and theft, and (4) rule violation. Just 3 of the 15 symptoms suffice for diag- nosis (they need not be spread across multiple categories). With these criteria, 6\u201316% of boys will score positive for CD; for girls, prevalence is perhaps half that. Imputed causes",
    "aggression, (2) destruc- tion, (3) lying and theft, and (4) rule violation. Just 3 of the 15 symptoms suffice for diag- nosis (they need not be spread across multiple categories). With these criteria, 6\u201316% of boys will score positive for CD; for girls, prevalence is perhaps half that. Imputed causes include the environment (large families, neglect, abuse) and genetics (substance use, CD, ADHD, psychosis). About 80% of children diagnosed as having CD have previously had ODD. (In fact, some writers question whether ODD and CD are two disorders or one.) But what we really want to know is this: To what degree will such behavior persist into adolescence and beyond? Children who are highly aggressive by age 7 or 8 are at risk for a serious and con - stant antisocial/aggressive lifestyle. They are three times as likely as other children to have police records as adults. Indeed, the age of onset\u2014before versus at or after age 10 years\u2014confers enough predictive power that we are encouraged to state it as a speci - fier. Those with earlier onset (mostly boys) are more likely to be aggressive; half of them will progress to a diagnosis of ASPD. Later onset predicts an outcome less fraught. Girls with early-onset CD are less likely than boys to develop ASPD; rather, they may develop somatic symptom disorder, suicidal behavior, social and occupational prob - lems, or other emotional disorders. What about CD in adults? As with ODD, the diagnosis is at least theoretically possible, but it is far more likely that an adult will have some other disorder that will obscure the CD symptoms. Milo Tark\u2019s early history (p. 543) illustrates some of the symptoms of CD; Dudley Langenegger\u2019s early history (p. 437) included a few of its elements. Essential Features of Conduct Disorder In various ways, these people chronically disrespect rules and other people\u2019s rights. Most egregiously, they use aggression against their peers (and sometimes elders)\u2014 bullying, starting fights, using dangerous weapons, showing cruelty to people or animals, even sexual abuse. They may intentionally set fires or otherwise destroy property; breaking and entering, lying, and theft are well within their repertoires. Truancy, repeated runaways, and refusal against a parent\u2019s wishes to come home at night round out their bag of tricks.

Specify severity: Mild. Has sufficient, but not a lot of symptoms, and harm to others is minimal. Moderate. Symptoms and harm to others are intermediate. Severe. Many symptoms, much harm to others. Specify if: With limited prosocial emotions. See separate discussion below. With Limited Prosocial Emotions Specifier for Conduct Disorder The above- described criteria for CD address the behavior of these patients. The speci- fier with limited prosocial emotions asks us to engage with the emotional underpin - nings of\u2014or reactions to\u2014that behavior. CD behavior can take either of two forms. In one, the patient has trouble regulat- ing powerful, angry, hostile emotions. These children tend to come from dysfunctional families that are prone to physical abuse. They are likely to be rejected by their peers, leading to aggression, playing truant, and associating with delinquents. Rather than possessing emotions such as anger and hostility, a minority of patients with CD lack something\u2014 empathy and guilt. These children tend to use others for their own gain. With low anxiety levels and the tendency to become easily bored, they prefer activities that are novel, exciting, even dangerous. As a result, they typi - cally report the four symptoms mentioned in the specifier with limited prosocial emotions. That is, they might report the four specifier symptoms. However, candor isn\u2019t nec- essarily the strong suit of these young people, who are loath to reveal personal feelings (and much about behavior). So it\u2019s more important than ever to seek collateral sources of information. Reading the prototype, you can see why this is sometimes called the callous unemotional type of CD, from which the specifier was renamed because the older label sounded so pejorative. (Use of the CD",
    "(and much about behavior). So it\u2019s more important than ever to seek collateral sources of information. Reading the prototype, you can see why this is sometimes called the callous unemotional type of CD, from which the specifier was renamed because the older label sounded so pejorative. (Use of the CD diagnosis has fallen off in recent years, anyway, partly because it is stigmatizing.) Call it what you will, this subtype of CD predicts an adolescence with more severe, persistent problems of conduct. With Limited Prosocial Emotions Specifier for Conduct Disorder 383 Essential Features of With Limited Prosocial Emotions Specifier for Conduct Disorder Such patients lack important emotional underpinnings. They have a callous absence of empathy (that is, they are without concern for the emotions or suffering of oth - ers). They tend to have limited affect and little remorse or guilt (other than regret if caught). They are indifferent to the quality of their own performance. The Fine Print To receive the specifier, these symptoms must be experienced within the past year. With DSM-5 criteria, you can\u2019t code a patient with c D as without limited prosocial emo- tions. I think this is a mistake\u2014one that clinicians can, and should, correct. There\u2019s no special code number attached to the with limited prosocial emotions designation. It\u2019s only verbiage you tack onto the diagnosis. So for any patient with cD, you can add \u201cWith limited prosocial emotions\u201d or \u201cWithout limited prosocial emotions.\u201d The double negative conveys valuable information about the patient, whatever the severity status. (Well, I\u2019m assuming that everyone knows what prosocial signifies, or even means.) F60.2 [301.7] Antisocial Personality Disorder Last on the path that often connects with ODD and CD comes ASPD, which is more or less the culmination of aggressive, destructive behavior that sets all of society against such patients\u2014whom we soon begin to call perpetrators. However, I\u2019ll follow DSM-5\u2019s lead and defer presentation to its other proper place\u2014along with the other personality disorders in Chapter 17 (p. 541). F63.81 [312.34] Intermittent Explosive Disorder Whatever you might think of intermittent explosive disorder (IED), it is a condition with a long pedigree. a lthough it wasn\u2019t listed per se in the first DSM (published in 1952), the concept was there all right, hiding in plain sight on page 36.

    "a long pedigree. a lthough it wasn\u2019t listed per se in the first DSM (published in 1952), the concept was there all right, hiding in plain sight on page 36. There it masqueraded as passive\u2013 aggressive personality, aggressive type, whose symptoms were \u201cpersistent reac- tion to frustration with irritability, temper tantrums, and destructive behavior\u2026\u201d In DSM-II it was called explosive personality, which by DSM-III in 1980 had morphed into the familiar IED. With such a long history, it is surprising that proper investigation has taken so long to begin. It\u2019s enough to make a person angry. Really, really angry. 384 DISrUPTIVE, IMPULSE-CONTr OL, AND CONDUCT DISO rDErS People with IED have periods of aggression that begin suddenly (the classic \u201chair- trigger temper\u201d) on little or no provocation. The stimulus may be quite benign\u2014an off-hand comment from a friend, an accidental bump from a passerby on the sidewalk\u2014 and all hell breaks loose. The form the particular hell takes may be only verbal, but actual physical violence is a possibility. In either case, the situation may rapidly esca - late, sometimes to the point where the individual completely loses control. The whole episode rarely lasts longer than half an hour, and may end with the person\u2019s expressing remorse. Or posting bail. Patients with IED are mostly young males, and many are relatively undereducated (less than a high school diploma). The condition affects as many as 7% of Americans lifetime (2% in the previous month); the figures are higher for young people and for those whose education stopped with high school. Reported rates are considerably lower in other countries. Up to a third of first- degree relatives also have IED; some authorities suggest a strong genetic component. But a history of childhood trauma is also higher in patients with IED than in comparison groups. IED comes attended by other mental conditions, including substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders. The IED usually begins first, by a substantial number of years. (Clinicians note that in the case of patients with bipolar I disorder, it is important to make the IED diagnosis only when the patient is not in an episode of mania.) What\u2019s important about this is that we should vigorously attempt to rule out all other possible causes of explosive episodes before diagnosing this disorder. Essential Features of Intermittent Explosive Disorder The patient has frequent, repeated, spontaneous outbursts of aggression (verbal or physical",
    "patient is not in an episode of mania.) What\u2019s important about this is that we should vigorously attempt to rule out all other possible causes of explosive episodes before diagnosing this disorder. Essential Features of Intermittent Explosive Disorder The patient has frequent, repeated, spontaneous outbursts of aggression (verbal or physical without damage) or less frequent physical eruptions with harm to people, property, or animals. These outbursts are unplanned, have no goal, and are excessive for the provocation. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (aggression without harm 2 times a week for 3 months, or aggres- sion with harm 3 times in past year) \u2022 Demographics (the patient is 6+ years old, or the developmental equivalent) \u2022 Distress or disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use and physical disorders, cognitive disorders, mood disorders, personality disorders, ordinary anger; adjust - ment disorder for children under age 18; disruptive mood dysregulation disorder) The use of dual tickets of admission for IED (relatively benign \u201caggression\u201d twice a week for 3 months vs. harmful \u201cassault\u201d three times in a year) is something new in DSM-5 for Intermittent Explosive Disorder 385 this disorder. In fact, it\u2019s something new in any DSM for any disorder\u2014no other condition features intensity-based versus frequency-based dual qualifiers. Of course, the criteria for nearly every disorder allow for differing degrees of severity, but then they are stated in terms of numbers of criteria met, or the quality or frequency or duration of criteria that are demonstrated. The way it\u2019s stated here, IED occupies a niche unique in the diagnostic spectrum. The justification for this duality is the observation that there are basically two pat - terns of outbursts (high- intensity/low- frequency and the reverse), and that limiting the definition to one group omits from consideration a considerable proportion of patients who repeatedly have problems related to their aggressive impulses. In actuality, patients with IED may mix the two patterns of behavior. DSM-5 assures us that, regardless of which pattern a patient shows at intake, out - come and response to treatment will be roughly the same. Isn\u2019t it odd, though, that we aren\u2019t encouraged to add some sort of specifier that would tell the world just which bar the patient cleared to gain admittance? Frankly, I think it\u2019s another bull\u2019s-eye for prototypes, another black eye for fussy criteria. Liam O\u2019Brian From the time he was a teenager,",
    "it odd, though, that we aren\u2019t encouraged to add some sort of specifier that would tell the world just which bar the patient cleared to gain admittance? Frankly, I think it\u2019s another bull\u2019s-eye for prototypes, another black eye for fussy criteria. Liam O\u2019Brian From the time he was a teenager, Liam O\u2019Brian had had a flash-point temper. He had been suspended from 10th grade for using a pair of scissors to assault a classmate who had teased him about wearing the wrong colors on \u201cClash Day.\u201d The following year the police had visited him for breaking a headlamp on the car belonging to the baseball coach, who had called him \u201cout\u201d in a close play at home plate. After he paid for the headlamp, charges were dropped; the coach noted that Liam was \u201cbasically a good kid with too much red hair.\u201d That year a neurologist reported that his physical exam, EEG, and MRI were all normal. During his first few years of school, Liam had had difficulty sitting still in class and concentrating on his schoolwork. By the time he entered junior high, these behaviors were no longer a problem. In fact, he earned mostly B\u2019s and A\u2019s, and in the 2- to 4-month intervals between explosive episodes he was \u201cno more trouble than the average kid,\u201d as Liam himself reported to the interviewer. Following Liam\u2019s graduation from high school, his pattern of periodic temper flare- ups continued pretty much unchanged. After he was fired from two successive jobs for fighting with coworkers, he joined the Army. Within 6 weeks he had received a bad- conduct discharge for assaulting his first sergeant with a bayonet. Each of these inci - dents had been triggered by a trivial disagreement or an exchange of words that could hardly be called provocation. Liam said afterwards that he felt bad about his behavior; even the targets of his attacks usually agreed that he \u201cwasn\u2019t mean, only touchy.\u201d Liam was now 25, and his most recent evaluation had been ordered by a judge. 386 DISrUPTIVE, IMPULSE-CONTr OL, AND CONDUCT DISO rDErS Liam had been arrested by an off-duty policewoman in a supermarket. He had pushed her after she dumped 15 cans of tuna onto the carousel in the express checkout line. The usual examinations, X-rays, and EEG (this time with esophageal leads and sleep recordings) revealed no pathology. He denied ever having delusions or",
    "arrested by an off-duty policewoman in a supermarket. He had pushed her after she dumped 15 cans of tuna onto the carousel in the express checkout line. The usual examinations, X-rays, and EEG (this time with esophageal leads and sleep recordings) revealed no pathology. He denied ever having delusions or hallucinations. His father, he said, used to rough up his mother when he was drinking, so Liam had always been afraid to try alcohol or drugs himself. Liam denied ever having extreme swings of mood, but he did express regret for his unpredictable, explosive behavior. \u201cI just want to get a handle on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I just might kill someone, and I\u2019m not mad at anyone.\u201d Evaluation of Liam O\u2019Brian Liam had a history of many outbursts over a period of at least 10 years (criterion A2). The facts of his behavior would not be the issue here; he easily met the requirements for age (E), frequency, disproportionate rage (B), consequences (marked distress, D) and lack of premeditation (C). Rather, a clinician evaluating Liam should carefully search for evidence of other diagnoses that might merit precedence for treatment (F). Liam\u2019s mood showed no evidence of either mania or depression, effectively ruling out temper flare-ups that could be associated with a mood disorder . At wide intervals he had had two neurological evaluations, neither of which revealed evidence for sei - zures. He never touched drugs or alcohol, and he denied symptoms of psychosis. The presence of any such underlying medical disorder might suggest a personality change due to another medical condition, but there was no evidence of this, either. Patients with antisocial personality disorder will often act out violently and unpredictably, but, unlike Liam, they do not feel remorse afterwards. Neither did he show the manipulation, deceit, and callousness that are required by DSM-5 for ASPD. Patients with borderline personality disorder will sometimes have temper outbursts and engage in fights, but the generic criteria for personality disorder (p. 531) urge us first to rule out other mental disorders. I\u2019d give Liam a GAF score of 51 and this diag - nosis: F63.81 [312.34] Intermittent explosive disorder F63.1 [312.33] Pyromania As with the relationship of kleptomania to shoplifting, pyromania accounts for only a small minority of fire setters.

    "this diag - nosis: F63.81 [312.34] Intermittent explosive disorder F63.1 [312.33] Pyromania As with the relationship of kleptomania to shoplifting, pyromania accounts for only a small minority of fire setters. Only when there is a typical history of yielding with relief to an irresistible impulse can the diagnosis be sustained. At least 80% of these people are male; often the behavior begins in childhood. With their interest in various aspects of fire, they will turn in false alarms, appear as spectators at fires, or collect the apparatus used by firefighters. They may even serve as volunteer firefighters, thereby becoming their own best customers. Pyromania 387 Although pyromania is classified as an impulse- control disorder, these patients may make advance preparations, such as searching out a site and collecting combusti - bles. They may also leave clues, almost as if they want to be identified and apprehended. Fire setters may have low self- esteem and reportedly often have problems getting along with peers. Look for coexisting CD, ASPD, substance misuse, and anxiety disorders in these people. As a free- standing diagnosis, pyromania is probably rare, with (again) more instances reported in males. Essential Features of Pyromania These patients deliberately set multiple fires, but without motivation for profit, revenge, an act of terrorism, or other gain. Rather, theirs is a general interest in fire and its appurtenances (fire trucks, the exciting aftermath). Such patients feel tense or excited before starting the fire, and experience a sense of release or pleasure afterwards. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Differential diagnosis (mood and psychotic disorders, CD, delirium or dementia, intellectual disability, ordinary criminal behavior) Elwood Telfer Elwood Telfer\u2019s earliest childhood memory was of a candle burning on the kitchen table. He would kneel on a chair as his mother sat in the dark and waited for his father to come home. His father drank, so they often waited a very long time. Periodically, she would put a strand of her own hair into the flame, sending a curl of acrid smoke spiral- ing toward the ceiling. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been fascinated by fire,\u201d Elwood told a forensic exam- iner when he was 27. \u201cI even have a big collection of firefighting memorabilia\u2014old helmets, a badge from an 1896 fire brigade, and so on.

    "fire,\u201d Elwood told a forensic exam- iner when he was 27. \u201cI even have a big collection of firefighting memorabilia\u2014old helmets, a badge from an 1896 fire brigade, and so on. I get them at antique shows.\u201d Elwood had set his first fire when he was only 7. He had found an old Zippo lighter that still had enough flint, and he used it on an oily rag that was lying in a hay field. About a quarter-acre burned in the 20 exhilarating minutes before the fire trucks arrived to put it out. He always remembered the day\u2019s excitement as being well worth the beating his father had administered, once he\u2019d sobered up. Elwood set most of his fires in fields or vacant lots. Once or twice he had torched an abandoned house, after first making sure that no one, not even a transient, could be inside. \u201cI never wanted to hurt anyone,\u201d he told the examiner. \u201cIt\u2019s the warmth and the color of the flame and the excitement I like. I\u2019m not mad at anybody.\u201d 388 DISrUPTIVE, IMPULSE-CONTr OL, AND CONDUCT DISO rDErS Elwood had hardly ever had friends. When he entered high school, he was over - joyed to learn that there was a club called the Fire Squad. When he inquired about joining, two upperclassmen laughed and told him that it was an honorary group you could only belong to if you had lettered in football. Elwood felt almost sick with disap- pointment. That evening he started a small brush fire that consumed a neighbor\u2019s tool shed. It was the first time he noticed the healing effect of fire. Months might go by when he was inactive and calm. Then he would spot a field or empty building that seemed right, and the tension would begin to mount. He might deliberately let it build over several days, to enhance the feeling of release that was almost orgasmic. But he indignantly denied that he ever masturbated at a fire scene. \u201cI\u2019m no pervert,\u201d he said. After he graduated from high school, Elwood took enough accountancy courses to obtain a job as bookkeeper for a security alarm company. He had worked steadily at that job until the present time. He had never married, hadn\u2019t even dated, and had no close friends. In fact, he actually felt uncomfortable around other people. The forensic clinician noted no abnormalities of mood, cognition,",
    "a job as bookkeeper for a security alarm company. He had worked steadily at that job until the present time. He had never married, hadn\u2019t even dated, and had no close friends. In fact, he actually felt uncomfortable around other people. The forensic clinician noted no abnormalities of mood, cognition, or content of thought. Elwood\u2019s only arrest ever, which was the reason for the forensic evaluation, came about because of a change in the weather. It was summertime, and all week the wind had been blowing steadily off the ocean. Elwood had located a promising field of dry grass and manzanita. On Saturday morning he was off work, and the wind still held. With almost uncontrollable excitement, he used a tin of gasoline to start the fire. He reacted with horror and panic when the wind suddenly began to blow toward the ocean; the fire jumped the small service road he had driven in on, and gobbled up his car and several beach dwellings. Firefighters and police found him sitting on the stony beach, crying quietly. When the police searched Elwood\u2019s apartment, they found a huge collection of videos depicting newscasts of wildfires. Evaluation of Elwood Telfer The phenomenon of \u201ctension and release\u201d required for a diagnosis of pyromania (criteria B, D) is well detailed in the vignette. And there\u2019s also not much argument that Elwood deliberately set fires (A) and was fascinated by them and the trappings of firefighting (C). His clinician\u2019s task would be to sort through the differential diagnosis, which is not unlike that for kleptomania. Patients with ASPD or other personality disorders will sometimes set fires for either profit or revenge. But Elwood had worked at one job for a decade, and his legal difficulties were restricted to fire setting. Patients with cogni - tive disorders will sometimes set their clothing or kitchens ablaze through inattention. However, Elwood had symptoms of none of these conditions (F). Patients with schizophrenia, a manic episode, or other severe mental conditions may sometimes set fires to communicate their desires (for example, to be released from jail, to be returned to a former place of residence). This behavior has been termed com- Pyromania 389 municative arson . Another item to consider in the differential diagnosis is arson with a purpose: fires set as a matter of political protest or sabotage, or fires set for profit (E), none of which applied to",
    "a former place of residence). This behavior has been termed com- Pyromania 389 municative arson . Another item to consider in the differential diagnosis is arson with a purpose: fires set as a matter of political protest or sabotage, or fires set for profit (E), none of which applied to Elwood. Although Elwood had a great deal of difficulty relating to other people, this vignette includes insufficient evidence to support a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder. This is not to say that it might not be warranted, only that more information would be needed. I\u2019d make a note that he had \u201cavoidant personality features.\u201d A very low GAF score (20) would be given because of Elwood\u2019s potential for harming others with his behavior. F63.1 [312.33] Pyromania among other things, two \u201cmanias\u201d are included in this chapter. (another, trichotillomania, has been moved to the new DSM-5 section on obsessive\u2013 compulsive and related disor- ders; see chapter 5.) In these disorders, the term is not used by itself in the sense of having a manic episode. Rather, as a suffix, it means having a passion or enthusiasm (\u201cmadness\u201d in Greek) for something. F63.2 [312.32] Kleptomania In kleptomania, stealing occurs not as the result of need, or even necessarily of desire. When caught, these patients typically have enough money with them to pay for what - ever they have taken. Once they have left the scene undetected, they may give away or discard their loot. These people recognize that their behavior is wrong, but they cannot resist. Fear (of apprehension), guilt, and depression are frequent accompani - ments. OK, many otherwise normal people have stolen something\u2014over a quarter of col- lege students in one study admitted to it\u2014but fewer than 0.5% met criteria for klep - tomania. (The diagnosis is much more common, up to 8%, in inpatient samples.) It\u2019s especially common among younger people; indeed, it typically begins in adolescence. Women outnumber men by perhaps 2:1. Once it begins, often in childhood, it tends to be chronic. Dating back over 200 years, kleptomania is one of the oldest named disorders in the diagnostic manuals. It is probably also highly overused. Although fewer than 1 in 20 shoplifters can be accurately diagnosed with this disorder, many try to avoid prosecu - tion when they are caught by claiming that they were driven by an irresistible impulse.

Although fewer than 1 in 20 shoplifters can be accurately diagnosed with this disorder, many try to avoid prosecu - tion when they are caught by claiming that they were driven by an irresistible impulse. Look for substance misuse and depression as comorbid diagnoses. 390 DISrUPTIVE, IMPULSE-CONTr OL, AND CONDUCT DISO rDErS Essential Features of Kleptomania Patients repeatedly act on the impulse to steal objects they don\u2019t really need. Before the actual theft, they experience mounting tension, which yields to a sense of release when the theft takes place. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Differential diagnosis (mood and psychotic disorders, personality and con- duct disorders, ordinary criminal activity, revenge or anger) Roseanne Straub \u201cFifteen years!\u201d It was how long Roseanne Straub had been shoplifting, but from the expression on her tear- streaked face, it might have been the length of her sentence. Roseanne was 27, and this was her second arrest, if you didn\u2019t count the one time as a juvenile. Three years earlier, she had been arrested, booked, and released on her own recognizance for walking out of a boutique with a silk blouse worth $150. Fortunately for her, 2 weeks later the shop fell victim to a recession; the owner, otherwise preoc - cupied, did not follow through with prosecution. Badly frightened, she had resisted the temptation to shoplift for several months afterwards. Roseanne was married and had a 4-year-old daughter. Her husband worked as a paralegal. After her previous arrest, he had threatened to divorce her and obtain cus - tody of their child if she did it again. She worked as a research assistant for a civilian contractor to the military, and a conviction would also doom her security clearance and her job. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I do it. I\u2019ve asked myself that question a thousand times.\u201d Aside from the stealing, Roseanne considered herself a pretty normal person. She had lots of friends and no enemies; most of the time she was quite happy. In every other respect she was law- abiding; she wouldn\u2019t even let her husband cheat when he prepared their taxes. The first time Roseanne had ever stolen from a store was when she was 6 or 7, but that was on a dare from two school friends. When her mother found the candy she had taken from the convenience store, she had",
    "her husband cheat when he prepared their taxes. The first time Roseanne had ever stolen from a store was when she was 6 or 7, but that was on a dare from two school friends. When her mother found the candy she had taken from the convenience store, she had gone with Roseanne and made her return it to the store manager. It was years before she was again tempted to steal something. In junior high, she noticed that periodically a certain tension would build up inside her. It felt as if something was itching deep within her pelvis where she couldn\u2019t scratch. For several days she would feel increasingly restless, but with an excited sense of antici- pation. Finally she would dart into whatever store she happened to be passing, whisk some article under her coat or into her handbag, and walk out, flooded with relief. For a time it seemed to be associated with her menstrual periods, but by the time she was 17 her episodes had become completely random events. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I do it,\u201d Roseanne said again. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t like being Kleptomania 391 caught. But I deserve to be. I\u2019ve ruined my life and the lives of my family. It\u2019s not as if I needed another compact\u2014I must have 15 of them at home.\u201d Evaluation of Roseanne Straub Ordinary shoplifters plan their thefts and profit from them (criterion A); they do not have the buildup of tension (with subsequent release) that characterized Roseanne\u2019s shoplifting episodes (B, C). People with ASPD or other personality disorders may steal impulsively, but they will also have histories of committing many other antisocial acts. When criminals falsely claim to have symptoms of kleptomania, malingering may be diagnosed instead. Patients with schizophrenia or manic episodes will sometimes have hallucinations that order them to steal things. Anxiety, guilt, and depression are often found in patients with this disorder. There- fore, watch for diagnoses such as generalized anxiety disorder , persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and major depressive disorder. Kleptomania may also be associ- ated with the eating disorders, especially bulimia nervosa. Patients with substance use disorder may steal in order to support a drug habit. None of these, however, applied to Roseanne. With her GAF score of 65, her diagnosis would be as follows: F63.2 [312.32] Kleptomania Tension and release (or relief) is a phrase that describes several DSM-5 conditions.",
    "nervosa. Patients with substance use disorder may steal in order to support a drug habit. None of these, however, applied to Roseanne. With her GAF score of 65, her diagnosis would be as follows: F63.2 [312.32] Kleptomania Tension and release (or relief) is a phrase that describes several DSM-5 conditions. among them are pyromania and kleptomania, but it can also be found in trichotillomania in chap- ter 5 (though it no longer serves as a criterion for that disorder). It expresses the typi- cal buildup of anxiety or tension, sometimes for a day or more, until the impulse to act becomes overwhelming. Once the action has been taken, the person experiences a sense of release that may be perceived as relief or pleasure. However, remorse or regret may later come to dominate the emotional landscape. F91.8 [312.89] Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse- Control, and Conduct Disorder F91.9 [312.9] Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse- Control, and Conduct Disorder Use one of these two categories to code any problems with the control of impulses or conduct that do not meet the criteria for the disorders described above or elsewhere in DSM-5. As usual, the other specified category should be used when you wish to be specific about a particular presentation; the unspecified category should be used when you do not wish to be specific. 392 DISrUPTIVE, IMPULSE-CONTr OL, AND CONDUCT DISO rDErS 393 CHAPTEr 15 Substance- related and Addictive Disorders Quick Guide to the Substance- Related and Addictive Disorders Mind- altering substances all yield three basic types of disorders: substance intoxication, sub- stance withdrawal, and what we now call substance use disorder (formerly substance depen- dence and substance abuse). Most of these DSM-5 terms apply to nearly all of the substances discussed; I\u2019ll note exceptions as they occur. In addition, because its diagnostic features and some of its physiological features are nearly identical to those of substance use, gambling disorder has been moved into this chapter. Basic Substance- Related Categories Substance use disorder. A user has taken a substance frequently enough to produce clini - cally important distress or impaired functioning, and to result in certain behavioral charac- teristics.

    "certain behavioral charac- teristics. Found in connection with all classes of drugs but caffeine, substance use disorder can even develop accidentally, especially from the use of medicine to treat chronic pain. The discussion, in which alcohol use disorder serves as a model, begins on page 396. Substance intoxication. This acute clinical condition results from recent overuse of a sub - stance. Anyone can become intoxicated; this is the only substance- related diagnosis likely to apply to a person who uses a substance only once. All drugs but nicotine have a specific syndrome of intoxication. The symptoms of these syndromes can be found summarized later in Table 15.1. Using alcohol as the model, a general discussion of substance intoxication begins on page 411. Substance withdrawal. This collection of symptoms, specific for the class of substance, devel- ops when a person who has frequently used a substance discontinues it or markedly reduces the amount used. All substances except phencyclidine (PCP), the other hallucinogens, and the inhalants have an officially recognized withdrawal syndrome; see Table 15.1. Again using alcohol as the model, a discussion of substance withdrawal begins on page 402. Specific Classes of Substances For quick reference, here are the substances you\u2019ll find discussed in the following pages. Alcohol (p. 397). Amphetamines and other stimulants (including cocaine) (p. 450). Caffeine (p. 416). Cannabis (p. 420). Hallucinogens (including PCP) (p. 426). Inhalants (p. 435). Opioids (p. 439). Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs (p. 445). Tobacco (p. 461). Other or unknown substances (p. 463). Other Substance- Induced Disorders Most DSM-5 chapters include disorders associated with substance use; every class of sub - stance is represented except nicotine. They can be experienced during intoxication, during withdrawal, or as consequences of the substance use that endure long after misuse and withdrawal symptoms have ended. They include substance/medication- induced: Psychotic disorder (p. 93). Mood (bipolar or depressive) disorder (p. 151). Anxiety disorder (p. 193). Obsessive\u2013 compulsive and related disorder (p. 214). Sleep\u2013wake disorder (p. 346). Sexual dysfunction (p. 370). Delirium (p. 483). Neurocognitive disorder, major or mild (p. 522). Non- Substance- Related Disorder Gambling disorder. These patients repeatedly gamble, often until they lose money, jobs, and friends (p. 470). 394 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS Introduction We of the 21st century have access to a growing variety of mind- altering substances, but using these substances can lead to basic behavioral, cognitive, and physiological problems.

These substances, all of which affect the central nervous system, include medications, toxic chemicals, and illegal drugs. Several substances. however, can be obtained legally without a prescription: alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco, as well as some of the inhalants. DSM-5 lists just over 300 numbered (in ICD-10) substance- related disorders. When all the subcodes and qualifiers are taken into account, there are hundreds more ways to code a patient with a substance- related disorder. For any of these, the clinician must specify the substance(s) responsible, the type of problem, and in some cases the time relationship of substance use to the onset of the problem behavior. DSM-5 uses nine major groupings, plus the catch-all other (or unknown) , to cat- egorize substances. These groupings are all artificial, however, and among them we can identify certain similarities: \u2022\u2022 Central nervous system depressants (alcohol and the sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics) \u2022\u2022 Central nervous system stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, and caffeine) \u2022\u2022 Perception- distorting drugs (inhalants, cannabis, hallucinogens, and phencycli - dine [PCP]) \u2022\u2022 Narcotics (opioids) \u2022\u2022 Nicotine \u2022\u2022 Other (corticosteroids and other medications) The terminology keeps changing, but the basic problem remains the same: the fact that people misuse alcohol and drugs. One of the problems with substance use disorders has been that because they have been so variously defined\u2014by different writers, for differ - ent substances, in different eras (and in different DSMs)\u2014there has been substantial disagreement as to exactly what they are and who engages in them. DSM-5 continues the DSM-IV tradition of defining the disorders related to all the substances in terms that are more or less uniform. The trouble is that the uniform keeps getting redesigned. The definitions now in use replace older words such as alcoholism, problem drinking, episodic excessive drinking, addiction, habituation, dependence, abuse, and other (often pejorative) terms applied over the years to people who use mind- altering substances. Of course, most adults use some substances; however, most of us don\u2019t use them pathologically. but what is pathological use?

    "the years to people who use mind- altering substances. Of course, most adults use some substances; however, most of us don\u2019t use them pathologically. but what is pathological use? Let\u2019s define it as use beyond which the nega- Introduction 395 tive effects outweigh any positive effects. Often this point comes up fast\u2014with first expo- sure, for some patients and substances. Usually the use is frequent, heavy, or both, and it always involves symptoms and maladaptive changes in behavior. note also that none of the symptoms of substance use explain why users like their chosen substances. In an effort to be objective and consistent, the DSM-5 criteria ignore many of the nuances of addiction to specific substances. Gone, for example, is the descrip- tive richness of the stages of alcoholism. y ou should consult mental health textbooks, scientific articles, and even literary works to supplement these criteria. One last note: For several months now, I\u2019ve been searching for a noun describing sub- stance use disorder that fits comfortably into the new nomenclature. I\u2019ve finally decided to throw caution to the winds and call it addiction. a lot of the substance use experts bemoan its loss, and it seems to describe the behavior well and succinctly. The Basic Substance- related Categories, Illustrated by Alcohol- related Disorders My approach in this part of the chapter differs somewhat from the DSM-5 format. I\u2019ll present the Essential Features of substance use disorder, intoxication, and withdrawal, using the example of alcohol for each of these categories. Later in the chapter, I discuss whatever intoxication and/or withdrawal syndromes apply to each of the other sub - stance groupings. I also briefly mention other disorders related to each substance, as well as other substances that may be used in conjunction with each substance. Substance Use Disorder As I have noted in the sidebar above, clinicians and researchers have argued for years about the definitions of addiction. The DSM-5 approach is to define substance use disorder as the core behavior of those who misuse substances. These criteria specify a type of addiction that includes behavioral, physiological, and cognitive symptoms. As an exercise, let\u2019s dissect the language concerning the diagnosis of alcohol (indeed, any substance) use disorder: 1. The use is problematic. Though it is perhaps begun to cope with other prob - lems, it only makes things worse for the user, as well as for the user\u2019s relatives and",
    "As an exercise, let\u2019s dissect the language concerning the diagnosis of alcohol (indeed, any substance) use disorder: 1. The use is problematic. Though it is perhaps begun to cope with other prob - lems, it only makes things worse for the user, as well as for the user\u2019s relatives and associates. 2. There is a pattern to the use. The repetition of this use forms a predictable habit pattern. 3. The effects are clinically important. This usage pattern either has come to the attention of professionals or warrants such attention. (Actually, the official DSM-5 language reads \u201cclinically significant.\u201d However, the word \u201csignificant\u201d 396 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS has statistical implications that cannot be sustained in clinical practice. I think important works better here. In this text, I have sometimes substituted the adjective material.) 4. The use causes distress or impairment. This says that the substance use must be serious enough to interfere in some way with the patient\u2019s life. Substance use disorder is thereby defined in terms similar to those employed for many non- substance- related mental disorders. 5. The interference in the patient\u2019s life must be shown by at least 2 symptoms from a list of 11: more use than intended; attempts to reduce usage; much time spent getting or using; craving; shirking obligations; social problems; reduced activities; use despite its physical danger; use despite physical or psychological disorder; tolerance; and withdrawal symptoms. Severity is judged by counting up the number of these symptoms that are checked off (but see my caveat in a sidebar, p. 402). Finally, in diagnosing substance use disorder, intoxication, and withdrawal, remember that rapidity of onset and rapidity of elimination affect the likelihood that a patient will have problems with any given substance. Rapid absorption of a substance (by smoking, snorting, or injection) favors quicker onset of action, shorter duration of action, and greater likelihood of a substance use disorder. A longer half-life (the time it takes the body to eliminate half the remaining substance) reduces the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms but extends the period during which the user could experience them. Whatever happened to polysubstance dependence ? DSM-IV used this term to indicate a situation in which a patient used two or more substances, but didn\u2019t have enough problems to warrant a diagnosis of addiction to any of them\u2014and yet, in aggregate, had enough symptoms from substance use to fulfill a \u201cgroup\u201d",
    "happened to polysubstance dependence ?

That defini- tion was a little complicated and tended to be seldom used. There is also precious little research to indicate that it ever predicted much of anything for anyone. In DSM-5, any patient who would meet the somewhat byzantine criteria just men - tioned would have to be diagnosed as having an unspecified or other specified substance- related disorder for each substance involved. Perhaps someone can persuade me there\u2019s a payoff in that. Alcohol Use Disorder Although nearly half of all adult Americans at least once in their lives have had some sort of problem with alcohol (driving while intoxicated, missing work due to a hang - over), far fewer (about 10%) have had problems sufficient to qualify for a diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder 397 alcohol use disorder. Note that the criteria are the same as for any other substance use disorder, which I\u2019ve stated below in generic form. Alcoholism is extremely common. More than 10% of the population of the United States have had the problem at one time or another; a man\u2019s risk is at least twice as great as a woman\u2019s. Onset tends to be in the teen years, though older age groups are not immune. Physiological complications such as withdrawal are likely to appear much later in the disease. Alcoholism is highly heritable; first- degree relatives have several times the risk of the general population. It has many comorbidities, especially with mood disorders and antisocial personality disorder. Essential Features of Substance Use Disorder These patients use enough of their chosen substance to cause chronic or repeated problems in different areas of their lives: \u2022\u2022 Personal and interpersonal life. They neglect family life (duties to spouse/part- ner, dependents) and even favorite leisure activities in favor of using their substance of choice; they fight (physically or verbally) with those they care about; and they continue to use despite the realization that it causes inter - personal problems. \u2022\u2022 Employment. Effort formerly devoted to work (or other important activities) now goes to getting the substance, consuming it, and then recuperating from its use.",

Effort formerly devoted to work (or other important activities) now goes to getting the substance, consuming it, and then recuperating from its use. Result: These people are repeatedly absent or get fired. \u2022\u2022 Control. They often use more of the substance or for longer than they intended; they (unsuccessfully) attempt to eliminate or reduce the usage. Through it all, they desperately crave more. \u2022\u2022 Health and safety. Users engage in behavior that is physically dangerous (most often, operating a motor vehicle); legal issues can ensue. They continue to use despite knowing that it causes health problems such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C. \u2022\u2022 Physiological sequels. Tolerance develops: The substance produces less effect, so the patient must use more. And once they stop using, patients suffer symp- toms of withdrawal characteristic of that substance. The Fine Print Tolerance isn\u2019t a factor with most hallucinogens, though users may develop tolerance to the stimulant effects of PCP. Withdrawal isn\u2019t a factor with PCP, other hallucinogens, or inhalants. Don\u2019t count tolerance or withdrawal that\u2019s caused by taking medication as pre- scribed.

Quentin McCarthy \u201cI can get off it, but I can\u2019t stay off it.\u201d Quentin McCarthy was 43, and he was talking about alcohol. He liked to say that throughout his adult life he had been successful at two things\u2014 drinking and selling insurance. Now he was having trouble with both. Quentin was the second of three sons born to parents both of whom were attor - neys. His brothers had been excellent students. Quentin was bright, but he had been hyperactive and the class clown. In school, he had never been able to focus his attention well enough to excel at anything but physical education. To please his parents, after high school Quentin tried a semester of junior college. It was worse than high school; the only thing that kept him going was guilt. Whereas his older",
    "he had never been able to focus his attention well enough to excel at anything but physical education. To please his parents, after high school Quentin tried a semester of junior college. It was worse than high school; the only thing that kept him going was guilt. Whereas his older brother was admitted to law school (with honors at entrance), and his younger brother mopped up the prizes at the state science fair, Quentin felt almost joyful when his birthday was that year\u2019s fourth pick in the national draft lottery. The following day he enlisted in the Army. Somewhere in his schooling Quentin had learned to type, so he was assigned to his battalion\u2019s administrative section. He liked to say that throughout 4 years in the mili - tary, he never fired his weapon in anger. By comparison with some of the older men\u2019s alcohol use, his drinking was moderate. Although he had about the usual number of fights, he managed to avoid serious trouble. When he left the service at age 22, he had held onto his sergeant\u2019s stripes through two tours of duty in Vietnam. After that, life suddenly got serious. Working part-time after hours in the post exchange, Quentin had discovered that he was a natural salesman. So it had seemed a logical move to take a job selling life insurance. It also seemed sensible to marry the boss\u2019s daughter. When 2 years later his father-in-law died suddenly, Quentin became sole proprietor of the agency. \u201cThe business made me, and it ruined me,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a lot of money having lunch with people and selling them large policies. I told myself that I had to drink with them in order to make a sale, but I suppose that was just rationalization.\u201d As time went on, Quentin\u2019s two- martini lunches turned into four- martini lunches. By the time he was 31, he was skipping lunch completely and nipping throughout the afternoon to \u201ckeep a glow on.\u201d At the end of the day, he was sometimes surprised to see how much had disappeared from the bottle he kept in his desk drawer. The past year had brought Quentin two unpleasant surprises.

    "kept in his desk drawer. The past year had brought Quentin two unpleasant surprises. The first came when his doctor informed him that the nagging pain just above his navel was an ulcer; for Alcohol Use Disorder 399 the sake of his health, he would have to stop drinking. The second, which in a way seemed worse because it injured his pride, occurred one afternoon over lunch. A long- time client of the agency apologetically said that he would be taking his substantial business elsewhere; his wife didn\u2019t feel comfortable that he was \u201cdoing business with a lush.\u201d Thinking back, Quentin realized that there had been several other, less blatant instances of customers departing the fold. The result had been his resolve to quit, or at least to reduce the amount of his drinking. (\u201cQuitting is easy,\u201d he remarked ruefully. \u201cI did it twice in 1 month.\u201d) At first he promised himself he wouldn\u2019t drink before 5 p.m.; that proved impractical, and he later amended it to \u201caround lunchtime.\u201d With the level in his desk drawer bottle reced- ing as fast as ever, Quentin decided he would try Alcoholics Anonymous. \u201cThat was worse than useless,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe stories I heard from some of those people made me feel like a teetotaler.\u201d A comment made by his wife eventually brought him in for evaluation. \u201cYou used to drink to have a good time,\u201d she told him. \u201cNow you drink because you need it.\u201d Evaluation of Quentin McCarthy The Essential Features of substance use disorder (see above) are not especially com - plicated, just tedious. Quentin\u2019s history of alcohol use illustrates many of them. At least two are needed to qualify for the diagnosis, and they must occur within a 1-year period. This is not to say that they must have begun within the year prior to evaluation, only that the problems must have been present within a relatively compact time frame. Note that some patients may sporadically present new symptoms and abandon old ones. \u2022\u2022 Using more. Many patients start out consuming relatively small amounts (\u201cjust a nip before dinner\u201d), but end up skipping dinner and just nipping. As a result, they use more of their substance of choice than they intend. Quentin was some- times surprised how much the level in his bottle had gone down by day\u2019s end (criterion A1). \u2022\u2022 Control issues . The person wants to",
    "but end up skipping dinner and just nipping. As a result, they use more of their substance of choice than they intend. Quentin was some- times surprised how much the level in his bottle had gone down by day\u2019s end (criterion A1). \u2022\u2022 Control issues . The person wants to control use or repeatedly fails in attempts at control. Quentin tried to quit by setting rules and attending Alcoholics Anon- ymous (A2). Others, for whom quitting completely may seem too drastic and frightening, may instead try to reduce the amount they use. \u2022\u2022 Time investment . This symptom is especially characteristic of those who use substances other than alcohol. (Alcohol users often carry on with other activi - ties, drunk or sober.) And like tobacco, alcohol is legal and hence easy to obtain. Quentin spent a good deal of time drinking, which would probably qualify him on this criterion (A3), even though he kept right on working. Other patients, especially those who use drugs other than alcohol, may spend a great deal of time ensuring the continuity of their supply. For example, see the vignette of Kirk Aufderheide (p. 447). 400 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS \u2022\u2022 Craving (A4). This is the only completely new criterion in DSM-5\u2014one that many authorities had complained was missing from previous editions. It has been linked to dopamine release in substance use and other behaviors such as gambling. We didn\u2019t note it in Quentin\u2019s vignette, but then perhaps the inter - viewer forgot to ask. \u2022\u2022 Obligations shirked (A5). Many patients with alcohol use disorder abandon their roles at home, in the community, or at work in favor of drinking. Quentin gets a pass on this one. \u2022\u2022 Worsening interpersonal/social relations . The patient continues to use, though it causes fights or arguments with close associates. You could argue (I would) that Quentin\u2019s customers\u2019 taking their business elsewhere was such an example (A6). \u2022\u2022 Reduction of other activities (A7). Patients with substance use disorders com - monly ignore work and social activities. This was not the case with Quentin, who devoted the necessary time to work (though some clients objected to his drinking). \u2022\u2022 Physical dangers ignored (A8). Driving while under the influence is by far the most common, but many others, such as operating heavy machinery, can also occur. The vignette doesn\u2019t indict Quentin on physical danger. \u2022\u2022 Psychological/medical warnings ignored . Quentin",

Driving while under the influence is by far the most common, but many others, such as operating heavy machinery, can also occur. The vignette doesn\u2019t indict Quentin on physical danger. \u2022\u2022 Psychological/medical warnings ignored . Quentin drank despite the danger from ulcers (A9). Other patients may ignore physician warnings about liver dis- ease (cirrhosis or hepatitis) or esophageal varicose veins, which can rupture after prolonged retching. Those who use drugs intravenously often continue to share needles, despite the well-known risks of HIV and hepatitis. Most substances can also exacerbate suicidal ideas, mood disorders, and psychoses\u2014which are likewise ignored. \u2022\u2022 Tolerance. When a substance has been used so extensively that the user\u2019s body has grown accustomed to the chemical effects, we say that tolerance has devel - oped. This is especially apparent as regards alcohol, opioids, and sedatives, but it can be found in all other substance groups, with the possible exception of hallucinogens. With tolerance, the patient either requires more of the substance to obtain the same effect or feels less effect from the same dose. Quentin expe - rienced some of this when he began drinking throughout the afternoon to keep his \u201cglow\u201d on (A10). \u2022\u2022 Withdrawal (A11). This criterion can show up either as a symptom picture that is characteristic for the class of substance, or as use of the substance to avert or treat these symptoms. I\u2019ve discussed substance withdrawal further on page 402. Quentin showed at least 5, possibly 6, of the 11 criteria for alcohol use disorder. The next vignette will reveal whether he also met the criteria for alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol Use Disorder 401 DSM-5 is the first manual to include severity criteria specific for substance use disorders. In part, that was necessitated by the deletion of the substance abuse category\u2014a staple of previous DSMs since 1980, and misunderstood by many clinicians as a sort of \u201csub - stance use lite.\u201d n umerous studies determined over the years that the substance abuse criteria failed in regard to both validity and reliability. The diagnosis of alcohol abuse, when made at all, was usually based on one criterion, driving while intoxicated\u2014a behavior that, while in itself dangerous, is a weak reed on which to prop a diagnosis. but most of all, the abuse diagnosis simply didn\u2019t predict enough to make it worthwhile.",
    "reliability. The diagnosis of alcohol abuse, when made at all, was usually based on one criterion, driving while intoxicated\u2014a behavior that, while in itself dangerous, is a weak reed on which to prop a diagnosis. but most of all, the abuse diagnosis simply didn\u2019t predict enough to make it worthwhile. The idea of severity criteria is a good one, but its implementation does sow the seeds of discontent, partly because we determine severity simply by totaling the number of crite- ria met. Here\u2019s the seed: not all criteria are created equal. Some imply far more disability and distress than others. For example, either tolerance or withdrawal suggests that the individual has been using heavily and for a very long time (in most cases, many months, and probably for years). Other criteria may have far less serious import. arguments with a spouse or partner, while not trivial (as most of us can testify), depend not only on the person\u2019s actual use, but on the other person\u2019s perception of use and, yes, tolerance for the behavior. c raving may be found even in individuals who don\u2019t meet other criteria for a substance use disorder. Fortunately, these are issues that are solvable with more research and experience. Maybe in DSM-5.1. Substance Withdrawal Withdrawal symptoms develop as the concentration of a substance decreases in the brain of a frequent user. The generic criteria for substance withdrawal are simple: They require only that the patient experience specific symptoms after quitting a substance that has been used heavily for a specified time. Stress or impairment must result, and no physical illness or other mental disorder must better explain the symptoms. The symptoms that develop during substance withdrawal are specific to the sub - stance used and are described in the relevant sections of this chapter. However, certain symptoms are found in withdrawal from many substances: \u2022\u2022 Alteration in mood (anxiety, irritability, depression) \u2022\u2022 Abnormal motor activity (restlessness, immobility) \u2022\u2022 Sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia) \u2022\u2022 Other physical problems (fatigue, changes in appetite) See Table 15.1 for a more complete listing. For a substance to cause withdrawal symptoms, patients must first become tolerant to it.

Heroin may require only a few injections, whereas for alcohol, weeks of heavy drinking are usually needed to produce clinically important tolerance. Most patients who are dependent on a substance will experience withdrawal if it is suddenly denied them. Some substances do not produce withdrawal. Hallucinogens, for example, can induce an addiction, yet no withdrawal syndrome has been reported. On the other hand, DSM-IV listed no caffeine withdrawal syndrome\u2014a serious gaffe, as any coffee drinker who switches suddenly to decaf will testify. Fortunately, DSM-5 has put that one right. The time course of withdrawal depends on the drug\u2019s half-life\u2014the time it takes for the body to eliminate one-half of the substance. Usually withdrawal symptoms begin within 12\u201324 hours after the last dose is consumed, and persist no longer than a few days. A powerful urge to resume use of the substance often accompanies the with- drawal symptoms. Analysis of blood, breath, or urine can attest to the patient\u2019s substance use, but more often evidence is obtained from history. Denial may color self- report, so histories are often more reliable if a relative or friend\u2014anyone other than the patient\u2014 augments the information. As a rule of thumb, many clinicians mentally double the amount of a substance a patient claims to have used. Essential Features of Substance Withdrawal After using a substance heavily and at length, the patient suddenly stops or markedly reduces intake. This yields a substance- specific syndrome that causes problems. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration to symptom onset (generally hours to days) \u2022 Differential diagno- sis (physical disorders, primary mental disorders) You can find the specifics of each substance withdrawal syndrome in Table 15.1.

Alcohol Withdrawal Heavy drinking for days or longer is required to produce alcohol withdrawal. (Drinkers can tolerate greatly varying amounts of alcohol, so it\u2019s hard to be more precise.) Symp- toms begin a few hours after drinking stops and coincide with a rapidly declining blood alcohol level. Nearly all patients will show evidence of central nervous system overac - tivity, such as sweating, racing pulse, or heightened reflexes (see sidebar below). The most common symptom is tremor; nausea and vomiting may also occur. Some patients may have brief hallucinations that last 12\u201324 hours. After 2 or 3 days, a few may even have seizures. Sometimes this common syndrome is called uncomplicated withdrawal . It is usu- 406 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS ally brief, lasting but a few days and peaking on the second. However, the accompany- ing anxiety, irritability, and sleeplessness may persist a good deal longer. The heavier the drinking has been, the more likely it is that symptoms will be severe, so \u201cuncomplicated\u201d withdrawal shades into other, more serious syndromes. The best known of these is delirium, which affects only about 5% of those hospitalized for withdrawal. When delirium occurs during the course of severe alcohol withdrawal, it is commonly called delirium tremens (DTs). When a patient has both seizures and delirium, the seizures almost invariably come first. Rodney Partridge, a patient with alcohol withdrawal delirium, is described later (see p. 483). Another alcohol withdrawal syndrome is alcohol- induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations. Formerly known as alcoholic auditory hallucinosis , it is an uncommon (though not rare) disorder whose symptoms can almost exactly mimic schizophrenia. Danny Finch, a patient with this disorder, is described in Chapter 2 (see p. 95). The number 100 serves as a useful reminder when looking for physiological signs of alco- hol withdrawal: pulse over 100 beats per minute; temperature over 100\u00b0F; diastolic blood pressure approaching 100 mm Hg. Rapid respirations\u2014though nowhere close to 100 per minute\u2014may serve as another sign.

Coding Notes Specify if: With perceptual disturbances. The patient has altered perceptions: audi - tory, tactile, or visual illusions or hallucinations with intact insight (that is, realization that the perceptual symptoms are unreal, caused by the substance use). Coding in ICD-10 depends on the presence of perceptual disturbances; see Table 15.2 (p. 465). Alcohol Withdrawal 407 Quentin McCarthy Again By the time Quentin sought help, he was drinking the equivalent of nearly a pint of hard liquor per day. He declined the offer of a brief hospitalization to detoxify, and instead began an outpatient withdrawal regimen of decreasing doses of a benzodiaz - epine. He was asked to return in 3 days. On Quentin\u2019s next visit, he looked gray and unhappy. He signed in at the registra- tion desk with a wobbly scrawl, and his hand shook as he reached out an arm to have his blood pressure and pulse taken. Each of these vital signs was elevated. For 3 days Quentin had drunk no alcohol at all. Beginning the second morning, he had felt increasingly anxious\u2014a sensation reminding him of his first night in Vietnam, when he had awakened to the booming of howitzers. His anxiety grew throughout the day. Although he was exhausted by bedtime, he hardly slept at all. When he arrived 4 hours early for his clinic appointment, he admitted that he had taken none of the medi- cine he had been given. \u201cI wanted to do it myself,\u201d he explained.

Within 2 weeks, he no longer needed the medication. However, because he felt strongly tempted to drink when he was having lunch with clients, he requested disulfiram (Antabuse) therapy. Three months later, Quentin was still taking disulfiram and still hadn\u2019t touched alcohol. He attended at least one Alcoholics Anonymous meeting each day. He had rescued his insurance business from the doldrums and had even persuaded two of his former clients to return with their business. However, he admitted that he occasionally felt acute episodes of anger when he wanted a drink. Further Evaluation of Quentin McCarthy When he stopped using alcohol (alcohol withdrawal criterion A), Quentin developed typical alcohol withdrawal symptoms (see Table 15.1). They included rapid pulse, insomnia, anxiety, and tremor (criteria B1, B3, B7, and B2\u2014though only two of these are required), all of which made him so uncomfortable that he hurried back to the men- tal health clinic (C). Going longer without medication might have put him at serious risk for withdrawal seizures or perceptual disturbances such as auditory or visual hallucina- tions. Then he might have qualified for other diagnoses\u2014for example, alcohol- induced delirium or alcohol- induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations. Of course, Quen- tin\u2019s withdrawal symptoms further substantiated his primary diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Could any physical or other mental disorder have caused these symptoms (D)? The differential diagnosis for withdrawal symptoms is long and substance- specific. For opioid withdrawal, it includes flu-like syndromes. Patients withdrawing from cocaine and amphetamines typically have symptoms of depression. But both Quentin\u2019s history and symptoms were so typical for alcohol withdrawal that other diagnoses would seem highly unlikely. 408 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS Before coding Quentin\u2019s diagnosis, however, we must consider the matter of course modifiers for substance use disorder. can someone go into substance withdrawal without having substance use disorder? If you scrutinize the criteria and do the math, it\u2019s theoretically possible. The criteria don\u2019t say it couldn\u2019t happen, but, aside from patients who are medically addicted (not to alcohol, we\u2019ll stipulate), it must be a rare event.

    "couldn\u2019t happen, but, aside from patients who are medically addicted (not to alcohol, we\u2019ll stipulate), it must be a rare event. Course Modifiers for Substance Use Disorder After at least 3 months with no substance- related symptoms other than craving, the patient can be considered for a course modifier of early remission or sustained remis - sion. The standard for early remission is 3 months to 1 year; for sustained remission, it is 1 year or longer. To either time period can be added a further specifier: in a controlled environment, if the patient is living in a facility that prevents access to substances. Such an environment would include jails and prisons (well, some of them), locked hospital wards, and therapeutic communities. Essential Features of Substance Use Disorder Course Modifiers These designations are pretty straightforward and self- explanatory. They do suggest a caveat, however, which I\u2019ve addressed in a sidebar just below. Remission Remissions are divided into early versus sustained. Until a patient has been clean (or sober) for 90 days, no designation of remission is possible. In early remission. Early remission begins after 3 months clean and sober for that substance (and without any of the substance use disorder symptoms\u2014 with one allowed exception: craving) and lasts until the person has been so for 1 year. (Patients are especially vulnerable to relapse during the first year of sobriety.) In sustained remission. After the first year, sustained remission begins. In a Controlled Environment Someone who is in early or sustained remission and lives in an environment that restricts access to the substance may be given this modifier. Good control of contra- band would characterize such an environment\u2014a well-run jail, therapeutic commu- nity, or locked hospital ward. Course Modifiers for Substance Use Disorder 409 In a controlled environment can apply to these classes of substance use: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimu- lants; other (or unknown); tobacco. On Maintenance Therapy A patient who is taking a medication designed to reduce the effects of a substance may be described as on maintenance therapy. It is listed as a specifier for either opi- oids or tobacco, when there are currently no symptoms of the substance use disorder. Why not alcohol, for which there\u2019s Antabuse? (Good question. See sidebar below.) Severity Mild. Presence of 2\u20133 criteria substance use disorder criteria. Moderate. Presence of 4\u20135 criteria. Severe. Presence of 6+ criteria.",

See sidebar below.) Severity Mild. Presence of 2\u20133 criteria substance use disorder criteria. Moderate. Presence of 4\u20135 criteria. Severe. Presence of 6+ criteria. There\u2019s a very good question implied in the statement concerning the specifier on mainte- nance therapy: Why does it apply only to tobacco and opioids? Why not to alcohol ( anta- buse)? Or anything else for which an effective maintenance treatment is devised? Of course, this statement is only a set of words, so you can apply it wherever you like. If your patient is doing well on antabuse, say so. Evaluation of Course Modifiers for Quentin McCarthy When he first came to the clinic, Quentin had been alcohol-free for only a few hours; at this point, his diagnosis of alcohol use disorder would have qualified for no course modifier other than severity (which was indeed severe\u2014we\u2019ve counted 5 or 6 criteria). On his return to the clinic after 3 days, moreover, he would also have qualified for a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal. But at his reevaluation, 3 months into recovery, he had no symptoms of alcohol use disorder (other than perhaps craving); his withdrawal symptoms had abated; and he was still taking disulfiram. (The occasional episodes of anger, when a patient would like a drink, are pretty typical for alcoholism recovery; patients themselves sometimes refer to them as \u201cdry drunk\u201d experiences.) According to Table 15.2 (which accompanies the discussion of coding toward the end of this chapter), Quentin\u2019s diagnosis (finally!) at 3 months would thus read as given below. His GAF score on admission would be 40; his 3-month GAF would be 70. I tacked on the \u201con disulfiram,\u201d though the official manual doesn\u2019t say I can do so. So far, no one\u2019s complained. F10.20 [303.90] Severe alcohol use disorder, early remission, on disulfiram 410 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS Substance Intoxication Anyone can get drunk. Anyone can inhale toxic fumes. Although most people who become intoxicated do so voluntarily, people can also be affected accidentally (for exam- ple, through exposure to industrial chemicals or drinking doctored punch).

    "voluntarily, people can also be affected accidentally (for exam- ple, through exposure to industrial chemicals or drinking doctored punch). Regardless of intent, for a diagnosis of substance intoxication to be appropriate, the central nervous system effects of the substance must cause psychological changes or behaviors that don\u2019t work well for the individual. Note that substance intoxication is almost always reversible. When there are permanent effects of substance use, look instead to another diagnosis (for example, substance- induced cognitive disorder). The behavior of an intoxicated person changes in disadvantageous ways; that is, the changes are problematic. (DSM-IV called them maladaptive , which I think is a useful term.) These include work/educational or social problems, abnormally labile (unsta - ble) mood, impaired thinking, defective judgment, and belligerence. This criterion is important because it helps to discriminate patients who are only intoxicated in the physiological sense (excessive digitalis, for example) from those whose behavior impairs functioning. A person who drinks a 6-pack of beer and then goes quietly to bed with - out disturbing anyone may well be intoxicated in the physiological sense, but has not earned the mental health diagnosis of alcohol intoxication. (Going to bed is a behavioral change, but not usually maladaptive. Quite the reverse, actually.) To diagnose someone as having substance intoxication requires both hurtful behavioral changes and physi - ological symptoms and signs. As for the signs of physiological impairment that will be noted, these tend to be substance- specific, but there are certain common themes: \u2022\u2022 Motor coordination loss or agitation \u2022\u2022 Loss of ability to sustain attention \u2022\u2022 Impaired memory \u2022\u2022 Reduced alertness (drowsiness, stupor) \u2022\u2022 Effects on the autonomic nervous system (dry mouth, heart palpitations, gastro- intestinal symptoms, changes in blood pressure) \u2022\u2022 Mood changes (depression, euphoria, anxiety, and others) You\u2019ll find more in Table 15.1. Then there remains the ubiquitous requirement that all physical illnesses and other mental disorders must be ruled out. As a general rule, symptoms of intoxication (or withdrawal) that last longer than about 4 weeks may point to another mental or physical disorder. For example, a drinker who still has depressive symptoms a month after drying out should be evaluated for major depressive episode.

Alcohol Intoxication The picture of acute alcohol intoxication is so familiar that it seems almost unnecessary to describe it again here. However, we should make several observations. There is a great deal of variability in the blood levels of alcohol different people can tolerate without appearing drunk. The range may be as great as fivefold (from 0.3 to 1.5 mg/ml), despite the fact that many jurisdictions now set the sobriety level for driving at 0.8 mg/ml and will be setting it even lower in the future. Furthermore, the symp - toms of alcohol intoxication are usually more prominent when the blood level is rising (during the early part of the drinking period) than when it is falling and the person is sobering up. Levels of alcohol in the body can be measured in urine, blood, breath, or even saliva. Alcohol intoxication should only be diagnosed when there is evidence (usually his- torical) that the patient has drunk enough, rapidly enough, to intoxicate most people. In borderline cases, this may mean factoring in the drinker\u2019s weight, age, and general state of health. Someone who becomes markedly intoxicated after drinking a small amount of alcohol would be assigned the code for unspecified alcohol- related disorder (see p. 415). We need to consider briefly a little semantic issue. That\u2019s the fact that the word intoxica - tion doesn\u2019t always means a substance intoxication, as we\u2019re using the term here. In the broad sense, intoxication just means that there has been a psychological or physiological change that may or may not have caused problems. For example, a person whose coffee drinking causes insomnia is technically intoxicated, but if that\u2019s the only issue, then it isn\u2019t problematic in a clinical sense. (by the way, this is a definitional quibble that is peculiar to clinicians and pharmacolo- gists\u2014you won\u2019t find it in the dictionary. not any of mine,",

There is also evidence of neurological impairment (imbalance or wobbly gait, unclear speech, poor coordination, jerking eye movements called nystagmus, reduced level of consciousness).

Coding Notes See Tables 15.2 and 15.3, toward the end of this chapter, for codes. Dolores McCarthy In one of Dolores McCarthy\u2019s earliest memories, she was 4 years old and sitting on her grandfather\u2019s lap. She would rest her head against his soft old cotton sweater. He would wrap his arms securely around her, and she would cling to his neck. Also clinging to him was a particular smell that she always associated with her grandfather. It wasn\u2019t until she was a teenager that she realized what it was: beer. By the time Dolores was 10, she had watched in horror as the old man died by degrees of cirrhosis. Then, in her teens, she saw how her father\u2019s drinking wrecked her parents\u2019 marriage. In college, when she discovered that two glasses of wine would ease her chronic sense of tension, she promised herself that she would use alcohol and never let it use her. Accordingly, she had evolved a set of rules to limit her consumption. She allowed herself only one drink before dinner, and never more than three in a day (except on weekends and vacations, when she could have four). From her father\u2019s unfortunate example, she had learned: Regardless of the occasion, never drink during work and never allow \u201cextras.\u201d Even on her 22nd birthday\u2014which was also the day she married Quentin, the young salesman in her father\u2019s office\u2014she had only four glasses of cham- pagne (just enough to maintain her customary comfortable glow).

Despite her control, Dolores had had two lapses. The first had occurred 12 months earlier, when she became pregnant for the first and only time. Although she wanted a child, she took the precaution of having an amniocentesis. When it revealed that she was carrying a baby with Down syndrome, she gulped several extra drinks and drove around while deciding what to do. A Breathalyzer- measured blood alcohol level of 1.2 landed her in traffic court just 1 week after the abortion. Alcohol Intoxication 413 Her second arrest for driving while intoxicated had occurred 6 months later, when she lost her self- control once again after her mother died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The day Quentin entered treatment was therefore only the third time he had ever known his wife to be drunk. Dolores accompanied her husband to his second clinic appointment. She had been worried about Quentin for several months, and when his agitation kept them both awake most of that night, she had gone down to the kitchen and poured them each a drink. When he refused his, she drank it for him. Then she lost count and had a couple more. \u201cAnything was besher\u2014was better than what he was going through,\u201d Dolores told the clinician that morning. After correcting herself, she spoke slowly and deliberately. On the spur of the moment, Dolores had decided that she should accompany Quentin to his appointment, to be sure he didn\u2019t get into trouble. They had taken her car, and she had insisted on driving. Quentin hadn\u2019t dared remind her what had hap - pened on the other occasions she had driven after drinking. Fortunately, traffic was light, and her only difficulty was that she needed two extra tries when parking in an unusually long space at the curb. As Dolores entered the clinic building, however, she stumbled and might have fallen if someone had not grabbed her elbow and steadied her as she wobbled into the waiting room. She fumbled with the large buttons of her coat until her husband undid them for her. She then slumped into a chair where, with her coat thrown over her, she dozed until they were",
    "someone had not grabbed her elbow and steadied her as she wobbled into the waiting room. She fumbled with the large buttons of her coat until her husband undid them for her. She then slumped into a chair where, with her coat thrown over her, she dozed until they were called into the clinician\u2019s office. Evaluation of Dolores McCarthy We\u2019ll first address the question of alcohol use disorder. Although Dolores drank more than the average American, she had had few problems from her alcohol use, because of her vigilance and the unfortunate examples of the men in her family. She had never drunk enough to develop tolerance or withdrawal symptoms, and her control had been almost unwaveringly iron- fisted. When it slipped, however, she\u2019d had legal problems: two arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol within a 12-month period. Drunk driving qualifies for using alcohol when it\u2019s dangerous to do so (criterion A8 for alcohol use disorder). In other patients, such evidence might include fights or arguments with family or friends, lapses in business judgment, or embarrassing behavior (such as mak- ing sexually inappropriate remarks). That\u2019s one criterion met for alcohol use disorder, but a patient needs two to qual - ify, even minimally. As we scan the list, we see that Dolores\u2019s qualifications were not impressive. She certainly had never shown tolerance or withdrawal, and there was no evidence of interference with her work and personal life. You might think that all her efforts at control would qualify her, but they were almost completely successful. OK, so we\u2019ll agree she had a persistent strong desire to use (A4), which would barely gain her admittance to the alcohol use disorder ballpark. Still, she would have a severity rating of only mild. 414 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS However, Dolores could claim several criterion C symptoms of alcohol intoxica - tion, any one of which would qualify her for that diagnosis. Shortly after drinking (A), her judgment was impaired (she drove\u2014B). She slurred her words, walked unsteadily, and had difficulty even unbuttoning her coat (C1, C3, C2). When she finally got into the office, she lapsed into a doze, but that\u2019s hardly a (C6) coma, is it? A clinician attending Dolores would have to consider whether a history, physical exam, or laboratory data would be needed to be sure her symptoms were not due to another medical condition (D). However,",
    "got into the office, she lapsed into a doze, but that\u2019s hardly a (C6) coma, is it? A clinician attending Dolores would have to consider whether a history, physical exam, or laboratory data would be needed to be sure her symptoms were not due to another medical condition (D). However, her typical symptoms and history of recent alcohol use make that seem unnecessary. A diagnosis of alcohol- induced delirium would not be warranted in Dolores\u2019s case: Although her reduced attention span and lowered state of consciousness had come on quickly, the vignette contains no evidence of cognitive changes such as disorientation, memory loss, perceptual disturbance, or language problems (though her speech was slurred, her thought processes seemed intact). The generic criteria for substance intoxication specify, as noted earlier, that the syndrome must be reversible. Of course, the question of reversibility could not be answered for several hours, until the symptoms had had a chance to wear off. Until then, the diagnosis could be made only on a presumptive basis. Although Dolores had had an abortion and experienced the death of her mother, neither of these events had happened recently, and so seemed unlikely to affect the course of her treatment; we don\u2019t need to give them a Z-code/V-code. With a GAF score of 75, Dolores\u2019 diagnosis would be as below. But to get the code, we have to make use of Table 15.2 and pinpoint intoxication with mild use disorder. F10.129 [305.00, 303.00] Mild alcohol use disorder, with alcohol intoxication Other Alcohol- Induced Disorders Toward the end of the chapter, Table 15.2 lists and gives the codes for other alcohol- induced disorders. Additional alcohol- related vignettes are provided elsewhere: Danny Finch (p. 95), Barney Gorse (p. 221), Rodney Partridge (p. 483), Mark Culpepper (p. 522), Charles Jackson (p. 524), Jack Weiblich (p. 554), and at least one patient in Chapter 20. F10.99 [291.9] Unspecified Alcohol- Related Disorder Use unspecified alcohol- related disorder to describe any alcohol- related symptoms that cause clinically important impairment or distress but do not meet full criteria for any of the disorders described above. One example would be alcohol idiosyncratic intoxica - tion. Some people react strongly to a very small amount of alcohol (too little for most people to appear intoxicated). For instance, a person who is usually withdrawn and unassuming may become hostile and belligerent after a single glass of wine. This condi- tion",
    "would be alcohol idiosyncratic intoxica - tion. Some people react strongly to a very small amount of alcohol (too little for most people to appear intoxicated). For instance, a person who is usually withdrawn and unassuming may become hostile and belligerent after a single glass of wine. This condi- tion occurs within minutes of the drinking, and lasts a few hours at most. Predisposing Unspecified Alcohol- related Disorder 415 factors may be advancing age, fatigue, and brain injury, such as that which might result from trauma or infection. This phenomenon has also been called pathological intoxica- tion; in DSM-III-R, it had a code number of its own. In DSM-5, assuming it is serious enough to cause problems, code it here. Caffeine- related Disorders Caffeine, the most widely used psychoactive substance in the world, is present in cof - fee, cola beverages, tea, chocolate, and a variety of prescription and over-the- counter drugs. Perhaps two- thirds to three- quarters of adults frequently consume at least one of these. Although tolerance and some degree of withdrawal are undeniably associated with caffeine, few people would ever experience enough social problems to qualify for caffeine use disorder; in any case, DSM-5 provides no such criteria set. Caffeine is the only psychoactive drug in the manual that carries no legal restrictions whatsoever on its use. Black coffee has long been used as a folk remedy to sober up people who have drunk too much alcohol. However, caffeine does nothing to relieve their symptoms. Rather, it only adds agitation to the mix for someone who was formerly \u201conly\u201d inebri - ated. F15.929 [305.90] Caffeine Intoxication The symptoms caused by \u201cMr. Coffee Nerves\u201d (the now- retired star of advertisements for Postum, a hot drink alternative to coffee) may seem too familiar to rate much space. However, it has been estimated that as many as 10% of adults may at some time have symptoms of caffeine intoxication, also known as caffeinism. The symptoms are much like those of generalized anxiety disorder (p. 191). The patient feels \u201cwired,\u201d excessively energetic, excitable, and driven. Loud speech, irritability, and jitteriness are also com- monly associated with caffeine intoxication. The effects are determined by several factors. Of course, the individual degree of tolerance is important, but so is the amount ingested. A na\u00efve user might experience symptoms from as little as 250 mg of caffeine\u2014just a couple of cups of strong brew.",
    "also com- monly associated with caffeine intoxication. The effects are determined by several factors. Of course, the individual degree of tolerance is important, but so is the amount ingested. A na\u00efve user might experience symptoms from as little as 250 mg of caffeine\u2014just a couple of cups of strong brew. However, even an experienced coffee drinker who takes in more than 500 mg per day risks intoxication. Other individual characteristics, such as age, fatigue, physical condi- tion, and expectations, can also play a role. A diagnosis of caffeine intoxication is usually not made in people who are younger than 35; perhaps it takes years to develop aware - ness that there is even a problem. Although I have not included a separate vignette in this section, the case of Dave Kincaid, described in Chapter 11 for substance- induced sleep disorder, illustrates caf- feine intoxication as well. (For Dave\u2019s full case vignette, see p. 347.) I evaluate Dave\u2019s caffeinism below. 416 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS Readers who are wide awake (my diagnosis: too much coffee) may have noticed some - thing funny about the I cD-9 number for caffeine intoxication. The humor is this: 305.90 has already been assigned\u2014to three mild use disorders : inhalant, P cP, and other (or unknown). What\u2019s going on? as this book goes to press, that excellent question still doesn\u2019t have a good answer. To be consistent, the assigned number for any intoxication other than alcohol should be 292.89, but consistency didn\u2019t win the battle here. I cD-9 code numbers seem to be have been assigned via roughly the same process as that involved in making sausages and laws, and I\u2019m guessing that we don\u2019t truly want to know the details. Here\u2019s the punch line: a fter October 1, 2014, I cD-9 will be history and no one will care. Essential Features of Caffeine Intoxication Shortly after consuming caffeine, the patient develops symptoms of increased ner - vous system and motor activity, such as fidgeting, increased energy, insomnia, rapid heartbeat, twitching muscles, intestinal upset, excess urination, red face, rambling speech.

Evaluation of Dave Kincaid\u2019s Caffeinism Dave Kincaid worked at a coffee- roasting store while he was writing his novel. He had free access to the rich, thick coffee they served there. He also snacked on quite a few chocolate- covered coffee beans. In all, he probably consumed over 1,000 mg of caf - feine per day (criterion A for caffeine intoxication), so he had reason to feel \u201cup\u201d (B3). He couldn\u2019t sit still when he was trying to type (B1), and at night he lay awake with insomnia (B4). Rapid heartbeat, abdominal upset, and nervousness (B10, B7, B2) are also fairly typical symptoms that can be encountered even with relatively mild caffein- ism (which Dave\u2019s was not). Most of the DSM-5 symptoms can be found after as few as two cups of coffee, though perhaps not in full concert, as with Dave. Muscle twitching (\u201clive flesh,\u201d as Dave called it\u2014B8), agitation, and periods of tirelessness require caffeine intake sub - Caffeine Intoxication 417 stantially greater (1 gram of caffeine or more per day). He had in all at least six symp - toms; only five are required by the DSM-5 criteria. No wonder he was distressed (C). Because its symptoms are sometimes confused with other mental disorders, it is important to keep caffeine intoxication in mind. If we assume that Dave included his mental health when he said that he had been well, he probably would not have had a previous history of disorders such as anxiety disorders (especially generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder ), mood disorders (especially with manic or hypomanic episodes), and various sleep disorders. He had once smoked a little marijuana , but he had never used other substances whose effects might be confused with caffein - ism. These would especially include the central nervous system stimulants: cocaine, amphetamines, and related substances. Ruling in or out caffeine- induced anxiety disorder and caffeine- induced sleep disorder requires some clinical judgment. For these disorders, the symptoms must be more severe than are usually found in plain caffeine intoxication, and they must be seri- ous enough to need independent clinical attention.

F15.93 [292.0] Caffeine Withdrawal In DSM-IV Made Easy, I noted that caffeine withdrawal wasn\u2019t an official DSM diag - nosis, but that it should be. A lot of other clinicians apparently had the same idea, for the clamor to move it into The Good Book began years ago. Caffeine withdrawal may be especially likely during changes in a person\u2019s social schedule, as during vacations, over weekends, and the like. Then that person is likely to encounter fatigue, headache, and sleepiness. Somewhat less frequent symptoms include impairment of concentration and motor performance. DSM-5 notes that migraine and viral illness are examples of possible physical disorders to rule out. Essential Features of Caffeine Withdrawal The patient suddenly stops or markedly reduces the extended, heavy intake of caf - feine, yielding symptoms suggesting flu (headache, nausea, muscle pain) and central nervous system depression (fatigue, dysphoria, poor concentration).

You have come to stay with a friend who, you realize upon awakening the first morning, eschews coffee and hasn\u2019t so much as a bean in the house. After frantic, futile foraging for even a jar of instant, you decide, \u201cThis isn\u2019t worth the effort.

Finally, in desperation, you make your painful way to the nearest Starbuck\u2019s. An espresso and a double latte later, your headache scurries for the exit, the day brightens, and you depart renewed, leaving a generous tip for the barista. Evaluation of You Look, this isn\u2019t astrophysics. You\u2019ve suddenly been cut off from your quotidian coffee fix (criterion A), whereupon you develop classic symptoms of caffeine withdrawal: head - ache, fatigue, irritability, and physical complaints that resemble the flu (B1, B2, B3, B5; only three symptoms from criterion B are required). You feel so lousy you\u2019d risk the dis- tress and social embarrassment of alienating good friends you see too rarely (certainly not recently enough to remember that they don\u2019t stock your beverage of choice\u2014C). Of course, you might have the flu or another medical condition , or maybe it\u2019s jet lag. Yes, you\u2019d need to rule out other, competing causes for your symptoms (D), but this shouldn\u2019t prove too onerous: With your GAF score of 85, You hardly need a physical exam; rapid improvement with a shot of the Elixir of Life confirms that the diagnosis for You is: F15.93 [292.0] Caffeine withdrawal I have an ulterior motive for choosing You as an example of caffeine withdrawal: It demon- strates how easily just about anyone can sneak into the DSM. Many books and articles comment on the countless a mericans (and, by extension, perhaps billions of ordinary people the world over) who could eventually be diagnosed with a mental or behavioral disorder. Even a decade ago, 46% of a mericans were diagnosable by DSM-IV criteria. If I sound preachy here, I apologize\u2014 without feeling especially sorry\u2014but I do want to underscore the extent to which we\u2019ve pathologized some of our most cherished behav- iors.

Caffeine Withdrawal 419 Other Caffeine- Induced Disorders Caffeine use disorder has been included in Section III of DSM-5 as a subject for fur - ther study. That\u2019s partly because quite a few long-time caffeine users develop symptoms of a substance use disorder. These especially include making multiple attempts to stop using and continuing to use despite knowing that it is creating medical problems for them\u2014and withdrawal symptoms. You will find a complete listing of caffeine- induced disorders in Table 15.2. F15.99 [292.9] Unspecified Caffeine- Related Disorder Cannabis- related Disorders Cannabis is the generic name of the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa, whose active ingredi- ent is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Depending on the variety of hemp and the place where it is grown, the leaves and tops may contain anywhere from 1% to about 10% THC, a figure that has been rising for several decades. (In some California locales, careful nurturing of selected cultivars has produced the latter figure and higher\u2014 a dubious triumph of U.S. agriculture.) Hashish, which is a resin produced from the leaves of the hemp plant, contains about 10% THC. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the United States, and indeed in the world. As many as 4% of all American adults may at some time qualify for a cannabis- related disorder. Since 2007, its popularity appears once again to be on the rise. Unsurprisingly, it is more common among younger people, especially men. The extent of the effect that the legalization of marijuana in certain jurisdictions of the United States will have remains, at this time, unclear. Use of cannabis more often than weekly increases the likelihood of addiction. People who suddenly quit after heavy use may experience mild physiological symp - toms that can last several weeks; these include anxiety, sleeplessness, and other symptoms similar to sedative withdrawal. The serious behavioral and psychological consequences seen in those withdrawing from other substances (cocaine, opioids, alcohol, and the like) are less problematic with cannabis. Therefore, it wasn\u2019t until DSM-5 that criteria for cannabis withdrawal were included in a DSM. Heavy users may learn with surprise that they have developed tolerance.

Heavy users may learn with surprise that they have developed tolerance. Relative to other sub - stance use disorders, the development of cannabis use disorder can take a long time. It tends to occur in the context of social use, which may be more common than with other drugs of abuse. Eventually, the familiar symptoms of substance use disorder emerge. Flashbacks are rare. So is depression, which, when present, is usually tempo - 420 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS rary and mild. Some patients experience paranoia that can last as long as several days. Using cannabis may worsen the psychosis of someone who already has schizo - phrenia. Cannabis may be one of the most difficult substances for some patients to stop using, simply because it causes relatively few of the medical complications that can motivate the cessation of other, more dangerous substances. Although cannabis is usu- ally smoked, THC can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract\u2014hence the stories you hear about marijuana brownies. Because absorption can be erratic, THC that has been swallowed is especially dangerous. Some clinicians believe that there is also a syndrome of chronic cannabis use. Though variable, the symptoms are said to include mild depression, reduced drive, and decreased interest in ordinary activities. Adolescents are especially likely to experi - ence cognitive effects from heavy use. These include decreased memory, attention, and thinking, which can persist beyond the period of acute intoxication and worsen with long years of habitual use. Cannabis Use Disorder The characteristics of cannabis use disorder are similar to those of nearly every other specific substance use disorder. The criteria are identical to those for a generic sub - stance use disorder (p. 396). For coding, see Tables 15.2 and 15.3. Cannabis Intoxication Devotees of cannabis value it for the relaxation and elevation of mood it confers. It causes their perceptions to seem more acute; colors may seem brighter. Adults seem to see the world afresh, much the way a child does. Their appreciation for music and art is enhanced. Their ideas flow rapidly; they may find their own conversation especially witty. The effects of cannabis are many and varied, with both negative and positive reac- tions strongly influenced by setting and frame of mind. Time sense often changes\u2014a few minutes may seem like",
    "for music and art is enhanced. Their ideas flow rapidly; they may find their own conversation especially witty. The effects of cannabis are many and varied, with both negative and positive reac- tions strongly influenced by setting and frame of mind. Time sense often changes\u2014a few minutes may seem like an hour. Users may become passive and drowsy; mood drifts into apathy. Motor performance suffers (cannabis notoriously impairs driving perfor - mance). Usually cannabis also produces red eyes and a rapid heartbeat. Often a user will appear more or less normal, even when highly intoxicated. Illu - sions may occur, but hallucinations are rare. Users generally retain insight; they remain unconvinced by their own misperceptions, and may even laugh about them. Especially in first-time users, intoxication often begins with anxiety, which can progress to panic. In fact, the most common untoward reaction to cannabis is an anxiety disorder. Some patients fear that body distortions mean impending death. Cannabis Intoxication 421 Essential Features of Cannabis Intoxication Shortly after using cannabis, the patient develops symptoms of motor incoordination or altered cognition (anxiety or exhilaration, poor judgment, isolation from friends, a sense of slowed time) plus telltale red eyes, dry mouth, rapid heart rate, and hunger. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration to symptom onset (minutes to hours, depending on route of administration) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (intoxication from hallucinogens and other substances) You can find the specifics of cannabis intoxication in Table 15.1. Coding Notes Specify if: With perceptual disturbances. The patient has altered perceptions: illu - sions of vision, hearing, or touch, or hallucinations with intact insight (the patient recognizes that the symptoms are unreal, caused by the substance use). Hallucina - tions without this insight suggest a diagnosis of cannabis- induced psychotic disorder. Coding in ICD-10 depends on the presence of perceptual disturbances; see Table 15.2. as with intoxication due to any substance, the criteria for cannabis intoxication require that recent use produce clinically important, troublesome psychological or behavioral changes. It would be hard to argue that social withdrawal and defective judgment are anything but clinically significant, but euphoria? Suppose a person reports feeling really, really happy and nothing comes of it? Then is that person not intoxicated? Some diagnostic criteria work better than others.

    "a person reports feeling really, really happy and nothing comes of it? Then is that person not intoxicated? Some diagnostic criteria work better than others. Some still leave much to the interpretation of the individual clinician. Russell Zahn \u201cYou got a candy bar on you?\u201d Russell Zahn shambled into the interviewer\u2019s office and slumped onto the sofa. He flicked a lock of hair back across one shoulder of his torn denim jacket. \u201cI know it\u2019s only an hour since breakfast, but I\u2019m really hungry.\u201d At age 27, Russell lived on general relief and was often homeless. In the hills of north- ern California where he grew up, the principal cash crop was marijuana. For the first sev- eral years since leaving high school, he had worked at its cultivation and marketing; more recently, he had been more or less exclusively a consumer. Now he had been referred to the mental health clinic by a judge who had grown weary of his repeated courtroom appearances for possession of small amounts of marijuana. Russell volunteered that he had enjoyed a joint in the alley outside, just before coming in for his appointment. Russell wasn\u2019t especially unhappy about being evaluated; he just didn\u2019t see much 422 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS need for it. He required very little to live on. Whatever his relief check didn\u2019t cover, he earned by begging. He had his own corner in the business section of town, where for 6 hours a day he lounged behind a sign requesting contributions. Every couple of hours he would walk back to the alley and sneak a toke. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke on duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for business.\u201d All in all, life seemed a lot better now than when he was a kid. Both of Russell\u2019s parents had died in an automobile accident when he was 6. For 2 years after that, he had been passed around among grandparents, aunts and uncles, and a cousin. No one really wanted him, and he had terminated a 6-year tour of various foster homes by run- ning away when he was 14. The alternative lifestyle of the northern California marijuana industry had suited Russell just fine, until he discovered that no industry at all suited him even better.

    "alternative lifestyle of the northern California marijuana industry had suited Russell just fine, until he discovered that no industry at all suited him even better. It had been years since he had worked at anything, and he supposed he never would again. His mood was always good. He had never had to see a doctor. He had tried all the other drugs (\u201cexcept smack\u201d), but he didn\u2019t really care for any of them. Russell stood and stretched. He rubbed his already brick-red eyes. \u201cWell, thanks for listening.\u201d The interviewer asked where he was going and pointed out that his appointment wasn\u2019t over. \u201cYou\u2019ve only been here about 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Russell slouched back into his chair. \u201cIt seemed more like an hour. I\u2019ve always had a lousy sense of time.\u201d Evaluation of Russell Zahn According to DSM-5, Russell\u2019s time distortion (typically, time seems to crawl) would fulfill the requirement for a maladaptive behavior (criterion B for cannabis intoxica - tion) due to recent cannabis use (A). It is not clear how clinically important this was for Russell, but the interviewer certainly noticed. Red eyes (C1) and heightened appetite (suggested by his desire for a midmorning candy bar\u2014C2) provided the two physical indicators necessary to make the diagnosis. For coding purposes, note that he had no evidence of disturbed perception (such as illusions or hallucinations). Of course, possible use of other substances (notably alcohol and hallucinogens, if perceptual problems are noted) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication. History and the odor of alcohol can be important to this differ - entiation and to ruling out mental disorders such as anxiety and mood disorders (D). Did Russell have a cannabis use disorder? He had smoked it for a number of years. Although he might have greater tolerance to the drug than the average user (substance use disorder criterion A10), there was no evidence that he used more than he intended or that he had ever tried to exercise control. In DSM-5, there is at last a withdrawal syn- drome for cannabis; stay tuned for more of Russell\u2019s history (below). Russell did spend considerable time procuring and using marijuana (A3), and his homeless, aimless life could have been due in part to the use of the drug (A4). (Alternatively, you could argue that a personality disorder caused these problems and the cannabis use.) The vignette Cannabis Intoxication 423 does",
    "(below). Russell did spend considerable time procuring and using marijuana (A3), and his homeless, aimless life could have been due in part to the use of the drug (A4). (Alternatively, you could argue that a personality disorder caused these problems and the cannabis use.) The vignette Cannabis Intoxication 423 does not suggest any physical or psychological problem caused by the cannabis. Still, considering the low quality of Russell\u2019s work ethic, the time he spent using, and his probable tolerance to the drug, a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder seems warranted. In any event, with no evidence of perceptual changes such as hallucinations or illusions, we can use Table 15.2 to arrive at a preliminary diagnosis. (ICD-10 gives us different numbers to use, depending on the presence of perceptual disturbances.) Note also that ICD-9 requires separate numbers for intoxication and the use disorder (see Table 15.3). F12.229 [304.30, 292.89] Moderate cannabis use disorder, with intoxication, without perceptual disturbances Cannabis Withdrawal As recently as the debut of DSM-IV, some researchers still wondered whether cannabis withdrawal even existed. Perhaps it simply took time to emerge from the haze created by a relatively weak available drug combined with relatively few truly heavy users. In the past decade or so, however, much evidence has accumulated that cannabis with - drawal is real\u2014that, indeed, perhaps a third of users experience this debilitating state at one time or another. It needs to be repeated that, as for certain other drug classes, withdrawal that stems from medical use should not be counted as a criterion for canna- bis use disorder. This is becoming ever more relevant in our era of medical availability of marijuana in so many jurisdictions, and legal recreational pot in a few. Half or more of those who experience withdrawal mention craving the drug, with dysphoria and restlessness. Some report vivid, often unpleasant dreams or nightmares. Symptoms can be about as severe as for nicotine withdrawal; in fact, some users substi- tute tobacco (or alcohol) to combat their withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms last for a few days to a couple of weeks; physical symptoms decrease sooner than do psychological symptoms. In several studies, withdrawal symptoms were a strong predictor of relapse.

Essential Features of Cannabis Withdrawal After stopping major, long- lasting cannabis use, the patient experiences symptoms of dysphoria and central nervous system overactivity, along with troubled sleep, poor appetite, depression, anxiety, restlessness, and physical discomfort from shakiness, sweating, chills/fever, headache, or abdominal pain.

Coding Note Coding is given in Tables 15.2 and 15.3, but note that ICD-10 (Table 15.2) allows only one code for withdrawal (there must be a use disorder, and it can only be moderate or severe). Russell Zahn Again Russell was taken into custody after his evaluation. A bored judge quickly agreed that he should remain incarcerated, then departed for the long Labor Day weekend. Russell\u2019s first few hours in jail weren\u2019t too bad. That day and the next, he talked to a friendly guard and played cribbage with his cellmate. But he slept fitfully, and by Sunday he was boisterous and agitated, hitting the bars of his cell with a spoon\u2014which was the only good he got from his dinner tray. \u201cI\u2019m just not hungry, OK?\u201d he snapped, as the guard removed the untouched meatloaf. Russell lay awake practically the whole night. He felt sweaty and had chills (but no fever), headache, and a cramping pain in his stomach that doubled him over on his bunk. \u201cIt was like the worst flu you ever imagined,\u201d he whined to the nurse practitioner making rounds, even though it was a weekend. The NP found nothing physically wrong and told the guard, \u201cJust a pothead com - ing unglued. A couple of weeks will put him right.\u201d Further Evaluation of Russell Zahn Can we stipulate that Russell\u2019s experience with cannabis was both long- lasting and heavy (criterion A for cannabis withdrawal)? Abruptly deprived of weed, Russell expe- rienced nearly every criterion in the cannabis withdrawal list, including anger (B1), anxiety (B2), insomnia (B3), anorexia (B4), agitation (B5), and abdominal pain (B7)\u2014 certainly enough to provoke the distress required for diagnosis (C).

We\u2019ll take the NP\u2019s word that they weren\u2019t due to the flu or some other physical ailment (D). The symptoms for cannabis withdrawal are a lot like those of withdrawal from other substances (alcohol, sedatives, stimulants, and tobacco), each of which we\u2019d have to place on our list of differential diagnoses. But the history makes Russell\u2019s diag- nosis crystal clear; to his previous use disorder symptoms, we would just append with- drawal. With all that we\u2019ve now learned, I\u2019d upgrade his cannabis use disorder to a level of severe, regardless of how many symptoms we can enumerate. Russell\u2019s GAF score would be 50 (about his highest level in the past year). Using Table 15.2, we\u2019d give Russell (no longer intoxicated) a diagnosis reflecting withdrawal and his use disorder. And somewhere in the summary I wrote up, I\u2019d want to stress the importance of investigating further for the possibility of a personality disorder. Right now, there\u2019s too little information and too much pot to allow any sort of personality assessment. Cannabis Withdrawal 425 F12.288 [304.30, 292.0] Severe cannabis use disorder, with withdrawal Z59.0 [V60.0] Homeless Z56.9 [V62.29] Unemployed Z65.3 [V62.5] Repeated arrests Other Cannabis- Induced Disorders You will find a complete listing of cannabis- induced disorders in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. Two possibilities deserve special mention: Cannabis- induced psychotic disorder, with delusions. This disorder involves delusions that are usually persecutory. It lasts only a day, or several days at the most. In the United States, it is rare and most often seen in juveniles. But in other countries and cultures (for example, Gambia), it may be more common. Most U.S. patients who have delusions associated with cannabis probably have other diagno- ses as well, such as schizophrenia and drug\u2013drug interactions. Cannabis- induced anxiety disorder. The case of Bonita Ramirez, a college stu - dent who had cannabis- induced anxiety disorder, is given in Chapter 4 (see p. 194).

F12.99 [292.9] Unspecified Cannabis- Related Disorder Hallucinogen- related Disorders Also called psychedelic and psychotomimetic drugs, hallucinogens as a rule produce illu- sions, not hallucinations. Two such drugs that occur naturally are psilocybin (obtained from certain mushrooms) and peyote (cactus, though probably not the one sitting on a shelf in your kitchen). However, phencyclidine (PCP) is a manufactured hallucinogen that has very similar toxic effects. I also discuss lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and other hallucinogens. (A withdrawal syndrome hasn\u2019t been established for this drug class, so the substance use criteria include only 10 criteria, not the customary 11.) Phencyclidine In DSM-IV, PCP was listed in its own separate section; in DSM-5, reason has prevailed, and it is now bundled in with the other hallucinogens\u2014though the respective criteria for use disorder and intoxication remain distinct. Called angel dust on the street, PCP is a hallucinogen with both stimulant and depressant qualities. In its typical street dose of 5 mg, this highly potent drug can produce psychotic symptoms so convincing that you sometimes cannot distinguish them from schizophrenia. A person with a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia who takes it risks activating serious pathology. 426 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS PCP was originally developed as an anesthetic agent; harmful side effects caused it to be scrapped for human use in the mid-20th century, and even its use in veterinary medicine has been halted. Its less potent analogue, ketamine, is still used as an anes - thetic agent in both human and veterinary medicine. However, because PCP is cheap and easy to produce (it can be mixed up almost literally in a bathtub), it is still some - times used by young men who value it for the euphoria it produces. Despite lack of a withdrawal syndrome in humans, PCP\u2019s addictive potential is pronounced\u2014as dangerous as that of cocaine and heroin, some say. When it is swal - lowed, symptoms begin within an hour; if it is smoked, they begin within a few min - utes. A high lasts from 4 to 6 hours and can be repeated in runs lasting several days. The use of PCP is seemingly limited only by the user\u2019s imagination\u2014by snorting, by swallowing, or by injection. It can even be absorbed vaginally. Now it is usually smoked in cigarettes, which are preferred because the effects from smoking occur",
    "hours and can be repeated in runs lasting several days. The use of PCP is seemingly limited only by the user\u2019s imagination\u2014by snorting, by swallowing, or by injection. It can even be absorbed vaginally. Now it is usually smoked in cigarettes, which are preferred because the effects from smoking occur so quickly that the user can titrate them with some precision, perhaps averting emergency room visits for overdose. PCP and ketamine are both used by relatively small numbers of individuals, espe- cially males in their teens and 20s. LSD and Other Hallucinogens The prototype of the manufactured hallucinogens is LSD, which in the 1960s was embraced as the first new mind- altering substance to be developed in generations. In the United States, legal manufacture of LSD has long since vanished; all supplies cur - rently come from illicit labs, largely in northern California. Newer synthetics\u2014MDA, MDMA, and others\u2014 continue to turn up. These are sometimes called \u201cdesigner drugs\u201d because they resemble the pharmacological properties of known hallucino - gens while escaping (at first) their illegal status. Then there are the venerable natural substances\u2014 mescaline, psilocybin, and lysergic acid amide, similar to LSD and found in morning glory seeds\u2014each of which is generally a less potent hallucinogen than LSD or PCP. During the past 20 years or so, LSD appears to have fallen out of fashion; it is now used by under 1% of college students. However, designer drugs (especially MDMA, which combines hallucinogenic and stimulant qualities; see sidebar, p. 451) may have increased in popularity. Most users consume other drugs, too. In many cases, drugs sold on the street are quite different from what is promised. Lacking a quality control ethic, vendors freely substitute cheap for dear, available for rare. Thus, for example, so- called \u201cpsilocybin\u201d may in fact be ordinary mushrooms onto which some entrepreneur has sprayed LSD or PCP. Tolerance to LSD occurs so rapidly that an individual will rarely use it more than once a week. More frequent use simply doesn\u2019t produce an effect worth the trouble. No withdrawal syndrome from LSD or other hallucinogens is defined, though some people reportedly crave them after stopping. Hallucinogen- related Disorders 427 because one hallmark of successive DSMs has been renaming disorders in the interests of greater descriptive accuracy, it is astonishing that the hallucinogens still retain their mendacious label.

    "though some people reportedly crave them after stopping. Hallucinogen- related Disorders 427 because one hallmark of successive DSMs has been renaming disorders in the interests of greater descriptive accuracy, it is astonishing that the hallucinogens still retain their mendacious label. (I emphasize still because I was similarly appalled two decades ago, at DSM-IV.) Typically, they do not produce hallucinations at all, but illusions; some writers have referred to them as illusionogens. now there\u2019s a movement afoot to replace the term psychedelic (\u201cmind- manifesting\u201d) with entheogen, used to denote a substance that evokes a religious or spiritual effect. I don\u2019t think it has a prayer. Phencyclidine Use Disorder and Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder The characteristics of the use disorder for both PCP and other hallucinogens are simi - lar to those of nearly every other substance use disorder in the manual. Except for the symptom of withdrawal, which doesn\u2019t appear to occur with most hallucinogens, the criteria are a straightforward adaptation of those for a generic substance use disorder (p. 396). I discuss them as they apply to the two vignettes that follow. Code numbers are given in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. Phencyclidine Intoxication With much variability, the effects of PCP are related to dose. Besides euphoria, PCP can produce lethargy, anxiety, depression, delirium, and behavioral problems that include agitation, impulsivity, and assault. Even catatonic symptoms and suicide have been reported. Some users experience violent, exaggerated, unpredictable responses to light or sound; as a result, clinicians may recommend sensory restriction for intoxi - cated patients. Physical symptoms include high fever, muscle rigidity, muteness, and hypertension. Heavy doses can result in coma, convulsions, and death from respiratory arrest. Essential Features of Phencyclidine Intoxication Shortly after using PCP, the patient develops serious, sometimes lethal symptoms of behavioral disinhibition\u2014 unpredictable impulsivity, aggression, poor judgment. With it, there are signs of neurological impairment and muscle dyscontrol: jerking eye movements called nystagmus, trouble walking or speaking, stiff muscles, numb- ness, coma, or seizures. Heartbeat or blood pressure can be high, and sometimes hearing seems abnormally acute.

When she was 12, her father had walked out on the family in the midst of the worst argument she could remember between her warring parents. The divorce had preoccupied her mother and driven her older sister from home, leaving Jennie pretty much on her own. By the time she was 14, she had begun smoking marijuana after school and some- times between classes. Within a year, she was smoking instead of going to classes. On her 18th birthday, her mother kicked her out of the house. She lived with a succession of boyfriends, each of whom introduced her to a new recreational drug. She had been in and out of mental hospitals and was a double alumna of the local Betty Ford clinic. Jennie\u2019s last interviewer was Patrolman Reggie Polansky, a young police officer. One Saturday afternoon, he was called to the sixth floor of a run-down apartment build- ing, where a young woman was sitting on a ledge high above the street. The sweetish smell of marijuana smoke enveloped Polansky as he walked through the room to the window. The ledge just outside the window was perhaps 10 inches wide. About a yard to his left sat Jennie, barefoot and bare- legged, wearing a cotton blouse and a thin dress. She sat quietly, her face tilted up to the late summer sunshine. On the pavement 80 feet below, a crowd had gathered. Gripping the window sill, Polansky poked his head out. \u201cWhat are you doing out there?\u201d \u201cJust ress\u2014jes\u2019 res-ting.\u201d With an effort, she finally pronounced the word. She didn\u2019t open her eyes or turn her head. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fly.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that. Come on back in here.\u201d \u201cYou c\u2019mon out\u2014here. I\u2019m Amelia Earhart. We can both fly.\u201d Jennie giggled, and they talked for several minutes. OK, she was joking about being Amelia Earhart, but she did think she could learn to fly.

    "We can both fly.\u201d Jennie giggled, and they talked for several minutes. OK, she was joking about being Amelia Earhart, but she did think she could learn to fly. It had come to her in a flash this morning, after she \u201cgot dusted.\u201d She\u2019d been using angel dust off and on for the past several months. Patrolman Polansky pointed to her hand. The webbed space between her thumb and finger was bleeding. \u201cYou\u2019ve cut yourself.\u201d Jennie said she must have done it on the jagged window cornice as she was climb- ing out. Perhaps it was a message from God. That must be it, she said, because she hadn\u2019t felt it at all. It was like God\u2019s wounds. Instead, she felt happy, strong, and light. She felt like practicing for the Labor Day air show on Monday. Phencyclidine Intoxication 429 \u201cLook how close the ground is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like I can just step down there.\u201d She stood, raised both arms until they extended straight out from her shoulders, and stepped lightly forward onto the wind. Evaluation of Jennie Meyerson Jennie\u2019s recent use of angel dust and badly affected judgment amply met criteria A and B for phencyclidine intoxication. Of the criterion D physical symptoms required, two are documented in the vignette: trouble speaking (her speech was slurred\u2014C5) and reduced pain perception (she hadn\u2019t noticed that she had torn the skin of her hand while climbing out the window\u2014C3). Two are what\u2019s required. Jennie also had an illusion (the ground looked close to her, rather than six stories down). Such perceptual distortions can also be the work of intoxication with other drugs, including stimulants, opioids, and cannabis. The odor in the room suggested to Patrolman Polansky that marijuana had been used, but PCP users often spray their drug onto something they can smoke (usually marijuana or tobacco, sometimes parsley). When reliable information is lacking, a definitive diagnosis often depends on a toxicol- ogy report. The vignette gives no information as to the extent of Jennie\u2019s problem with PCP, so we couldn\u2019t confirm a diagnosis of phencyclidine use disorder. The vignette clearly indicates that Jennie had had, at a minimum, previous occupational (school) problems resulting from her use of a variety of substances. Further diagnosis would depend on additional information about her usage patterns. All things considered, a provisional diagnosis of moderate to severe phencyclidine use disorder seems justified.

    "vignette clearly indicates that Jennie had had, at a minimum, previous occupational (school) problems resulting from her use of a variety of substances. Further diagnosis would depend on additional information about her usage patterns. All things considered, a provisional diagnosis of moderate to severe phencyclidine use disorder seems justified. Consider - ing the outcome, I think that the severity code I\u2019ve given is justified, regardless of how many symptoms we can conjure. Jennie\u2019s statements that she could fly and that she had stigmata (\u201cGod\u2019s wounds\u201d) were not firmly held, and therefore not delusional. This would rule out schizophrenia and any other psychosis. There was no evidence that her disorder was due to a physical illness (D). In other patients, rapid resolution (often without treatment) may help dif - ferentiate intoxication due to hallucinogens from other mental disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders. Hallucinogen users should also be evaluated for personality dis- orders and the use of other mind- altering substances. Jennie\u2019s postmortem diagnosis would be as below. Of course, her GAF was nil, and we\u2019ll never have the chance to explore her for possible personality disorder. F16.229 [304.60, 292.89] Severe phencyclidine use disorder (provisional), with phencyclidine intoxication Other Hallucinogen Intoxication The first symptoms of other hallucinogen intoxication are usually somatic. Patients may mention dizziness, tremor, weakness, or numbness and tingling of extremities. Percep- 430 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS tual changes (usually illusions) include the apparent amplification of sounds and visual distortions (such as of body image), as well as synesthesias (in which one type of sensory experience produces the sensation of another\u2014for example, a professor I knew of saw red, white, and blue upon hearing a C-E-G chord played on the piano). Hallucinations, if they occur at all, may be of vivid geometric forms or colors. Audi- tory hallucinations can also occur. Many people experience intense euphoria, deper - sonalization (that is, a sense of detachment from oneself), derealization (a sense of unre- ality in one\u2019s perceptions), dream-like states, or the sense that time speeds up or slows down. Attention may be impaired, though most users retain insight. The specific features are greatly influenced by setting and by a person\u2019s expecta - tions. Some users find the experience pleasant; others become extraordinarily anxious. A \u201cbad trip\u201d usually includes feelings of anxiety and depression; panic attacks may occur.

    "The specific features are greatly influenced by setting and by a person\u2019s expecta - tions. Some users find the experience pleasant; others become extraordinarily anxious. A \u201cbad trip\u201d usually includes feelings of anxiety and depression; panic attacks may occur. These reactions will occasionally be prolonged, characterized by fears of becom- ing psychotic. Usually, acutely negative reactions subside within 24 hours\u2014the time it takes to excrete all of the drug. LSD is an extremely potent agent; just a few micrograms (an amount that can be soaked onto a postage stamp) can produce significant symptoms. It is absorbed from the gut, and action usually begins within an hour. The effects tend to peak at 2\u20134 hours, and may last half a day. Like PCP, LSD and other hallucinogens can be lethal. Essential Features of Other Hallucinogen Intoxication Shortly after using a non-PCP hallucinogen, the patient develops symptoms of dys - phoria, misperception, or poor judgment, plus autonomic overactivity: dilated pupils and blurred vision, sweating, rapid or irregular heartbeat, trembling, reduced muscle coordination. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: Duration until onset of symptoms (usually 1 hour or less) \u2022 Differential diag- nosis (other substances, other mental disorders, other medical conditions) You can find the specifics of other hallucinogen intoxication in Table 15.1. Coding Notes In recording your diagnosis, use the specific name, rather than other hallucinogen. See Tables 15.2 and 15.3 for codes. Wanda Pittsinger Though she was 26, Wanda Pittsinger still worked at the cinema. She had started this job on a part-time basis as a high school senior; after graduation, she had moved to full-time and stayed on. The pay was entry-level, but making change and popcorn was Other Hallucinogen Intoxication 431 undemanding, and she got to see a lot of first-run movies (though not necessarily in start-to- finish order). Wanda\u2019s job had lasted longer than her marriage. The year she was 22, she had been married to Randy for almost 10 months. Other than a pregnancy (which she\u2019d also terminated), the main thing she got out of the relationship was an introduction to LSD. She still saw Randy occasionally, but by this time they were not much more than friends; about the only activity they pursued together was tripping, which almost invariably wiped out their sex drive. Wanda had tried other drugs. Marijuana gave her headaches; cocaine made her nervous. The one time she had snorted heroin, she threw up.",
    "by this time they were not much more than friends; about the only activity they pursued together was tripping, which almost invariably wiped out their sex drive. Wanda had tried other drugs. Marijuana gave her headaches; cocaine made her nervous. The one time she had snorted heroin, she threw up. But acid was just about right. It always raised her spirits and made her feel giddy. Sometimes, if she was looking into a mirror, she seemed to see herself melting. This didn\u2019t bother her; you expected weird things to happen when you dropped acid. Besides the usual colored diamonds, triangles, and squares, she thought that LSD could reveal new meanings or insights. She valued that sensation of thinking deeply. The experience was almost always worth the palpitations and blurred vision that were her only side effects. Acid even gave Wanda a better feeling about Randy. Occasionally she\u2019d still trip with him on a day off, and he continued to supply her with the little squares of blotting paper impregnated with LSD. As a present, he had once given her two movie tickets that had been soaked in LSD. She\u2019d kept them tucked into the corner of her dresser mirror. Evaluation of Wanda Pittsinger Wanda\u2019s psychological and behavioral changes while taking LSD were minor, and the pluses and minuses were pretty much a wash. They helped her tolerate Randy, but she lost interest in sex. One could argue whether these were clinically important\u2014they weren\u2019t enough to get her into treatment, as a \u201cbad trip\u201d might (criterion B). But she had additional symptoms of other hallucinogen intoxication: She noted the usual side effects of blurred vision and palpitations of her heart (D5, D4). She also had some typi- cal perceptual changes: illusions of lights, patterns, and shapes (C), and the sensation of having special insight. Moreover, she felt euphoric\u2014 another common experience with this drug. The differential diagnosis of other hallucinogen intoxication includes delirium , dementia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Beyond her illusions, Wanda had symptoms suggestive of none of these disorders. However, her clinician would have to do a com- plete workup, including a mental status evaluation, to rule out other disorders com - pletely. Hypnopompic imagery (visual imagery experienced between the sleeping and waking states) can take on the aspect of a flashback, but Wanda\u2019s illusory experiences occurred at times other than when she was waking up.

Hypnopompic imagery (visual imagery experienced between the sleeping and waking states) can take on the aspect of a flashback, but Wanda\u2019s illusory experiences occurred at times other than when she was waking up. DSM-5 allows a diagnosis of other hallucinogen use disorder, but it is probably rare. Like Wanda, most users take LSD infrequently; rapid tolerance (loss of effect) results from use more often than once or twice a week. There was no evidence pre - 432 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS sented that she had lost control over the use of this substance or that its use altered the way she approached her job or social life. OK, it\u2019s problematic whether Wanda could qualify for a diagnosis of other halluci- nogen intoxication (F16.929 [292.89]). I\u2019ll give a fuller diagnosis a bit later. F16.983 [292.89] Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder When a patient reexperiences some of the same symptoms that occurred during intoxi- cation, but in the absence of the hallucinogen, a flashback is said to occur. Symptoms of flashbacks can include seeing faces, geometric forms, flashes of color, trails, afterim- ages, or halos; micropsia (in which things look small); and macropsia (in which things look huge). Diminished sex interest may be a feature. The patient usually has insight into what is happening. Flashbacks may be triggered by stress, by entering a dark room, or by using mari- juana or phenothiazines. Although brief flashbacks, lasting perhaps a few seconds, are common\u2014over half of hallucinogen users have them\u2014only a small percentage report enough of these symptoms to be distressing or to interfere with their activities. These experiences usually decrease with time; however, they can occur weeks or months after use and persist for years. Essential Features of Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder After stopping the use of a hallucinogen, the patient again experiences at least one of the misperceptions that occurred during intoxication. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration to symptom onset (variable) \u2022 Distress or disability (work/edu - cational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (physical disorders, delirium, other mental disorders, hypnopompic imagery) You can find the specifics of hallucinogen intoxication in Table 15.1.

Wanda Pittsinger Again Wanda came for help because she sometimes found herself tripping when she hadn\u2019t dropped acid for several days. \u201cI noticed it one night at work when I walked into the auditorium just before the main feature. I saw myself on the screen, first all in green, and then sort of sparkly. Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder 433 Then my image seemed to sort of dissolve, and I saw that it was only a trailer for a Woody Allen film that would be playing in 2 weeks.\u201d When Wanda told Randy about this the next day, he called it a flashback and said that it was \u201ccool.\u201d Despite Randy\u2019s reassurance, these experiences worried her. She stayed home from work for a day or two, because she felt she couldn\u2019t cope with the flashbacks at work. She had never used drugs of any sort since. In the nearly 2 months since she had last used LSD, Wanda had experienced a number of flashbacks. Mostly she saw \u201ctrails\u201d\u2014ghostly afterimages of people or objects that had traversed her field of vision. A couple of times she had seen Randy\u2019s face on the ceiling of her bedroom. Once the kitchen table seemed to grow in size to the point that she thought that she would never be able to reach it to eat her breakfast. But she never again experienced her own image on the silver screen. Further Evaluation of Wanda Pittsinger Though the details had changed, when Wanda walked into the darkened theater on the occasion that eventually triggered her clinic visit, she experienced a recurrence of the illusions she had had during LSD intoxication (criterion A). Flashbacks of some degree or other are common; perhaps one- quarter of LSD users have them. Wanda\u2019s wouldn\u2019t qualify for a diagnosis at all if they hadn\u2019t so upset her (B). As in hallucinogen intoxication, Wanda\u2019s clinician would have to rule out delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and space- occupying lesions in the brain (C). She would not qualify for a diagnosis of hallucinogen- induced psychotic disorder because she had insight that her misperceptions were caused by substance use. The previous history of LSD use and the typical presentation would make her current diagnosis secure. Her GAF",

She would not qualify for a diagnosis of hallucinogen- induced psychotic disorder because she had insight that her misperceptions were caused by substance use. The previous history of LSD use and the typical presentation would make her current diagnosis secure. Her GAF score would be 70. F16.983 [292.89] Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder note that the description of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder doesn\u2019t distinguish it all that sharply from substance- induced psychotic disorder. Indeed, the principal bulwark separating the two is the verbiage asserting that flashbacks must not be due to another medical condition and must not be better explainable by another mental disorder. The requirement, like so many others, invokes your judgment as the clinician; your decision must rest on the patient\u2019s degree of insight and the history of substance use. The criteria won\u2019t help you a lot here; it\u2019s better to depend on the logic of your evaluation. Other Phencyclidine- Induced or Hallucinogen- Induced Disorders You will find a listing of PCP-induced and other hallucinogen- induced disorders in Table 15.2. Here are several that merit special mention: 434 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS Hallucinogen- induced mood disorder. Depression or anxiety is relatively com - mon; euphoria is rare. Sleep is often decreased. Patients may be restless and expe- rience feelings of guilt. They may express fear that they have destroyed their brains or gone crazy. Hallucinogen- induced mood disorder may last relatively briefly, or it may endure for months. Hallucinogen- induced personality change. Chronic or one-time use may lead to character change, such as the development of magical thinking or a basic change in attitude. Hallucinogen- induced persisting psychosis. Occasionally a hallucinogen seems to trigger a psychosis that may last a long time, perhaps forever. There has been a good deal of controversy as to whether this is \u201conly\u201d an underlying psychosis that might eventually have developed, even if the patient had never used drugs. F16.99 [292.9] Unspecified Phencyclidine- Related or Hallucinogen- Related Disorder Inhalant- related Disorders Accidentally inhaled, a volatile substance is called a toxin ; if it is used on purpose to produce intoxication, it is called an inhalant. Intentional users will breathe almost any- thing that evaporates or can be sprayed from a container. Inhalants include glue and gasoline (which are perhaps the most popular), solvents, thinners, various aerosols, cor- rection fluid, and refrigerants. Preference may be guided",
    "on purpose to produce intoxication, it is called an inhalant. Intentional users will breathe almost any- thing that evaporates or can be sprayed from a container. Inhalants include glue and gasoline (which are perhaps the most popular), solvents, thinners, various aerosols, cor- rection fluid, and refrigerants. Preference may be guided more by availability than by effect. Users value inhalants for a number of reasons. They relieve boredom and allevi - ate concern. They alter ideas, moods, the sense of time, and perceptions (producing changes in color, size, or shape of objects, and sometimes frank hallucinations). Inhal - ants are also cheap and, like everything else that is absorbed through the lungs, quick to take effect. Neurological damage from prolonged use of inhalants can be quite variable. Encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy are widely experienced. Also, there can be ataxia, symptoms of parkinsonism, loss of vision, and involvement of the fifth and sev - enth cranial nerves, producing numbness and paralysis of the face. Chronic users may experience weight loss, weakness, disorientation, inattentiveness, and loss of coordina- tion. Death, while rare, usually results when a patient uses a bag or mask that excludes oxygen from the mixture being breathed. Fetal malformation is another untoward com- plication of use. Three groups of patients use inhalants. Boys and girls experiment with them, often as a group activity; the incidence peaks at around age 14, though popularity has been declining through the first years of the 21st century. Adults (mostly males) can become Inhalant- related Disorders 435 dependent on them. Finally, they are used by individuals who are also chronic users of other drugs. Many inhalant users come from underprivileged minorities. Personality disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder, are common among inhalant users. Inhalant Use Disorder The characteristics of inhalant use disorder are similar to those of nearly every other substance use disorder. They are identical to the generic criteria (p. 396), except that, as with the hallucinogens, you won\u2019t find withdrawal among the symptoms of inhalant use disorder. (OK, there may be some mild withdrawal symptoms, but DSM-5 doesn\u2019t consider them serious enough to list withdrawal as a criterion.) Score according to the usual rules (see Table 15.2). DSM-5 notes that it\u2019s often not possible to determine exactly what volatile hydro- carbon is responsible for inhalant use disorder, and recommends using the general term inhalant use disorder whenever you aren\u2019t certain. Of course, if the",
    "withdrawal as a criterion.) Score according to the usual rules (see Table 15.2). DSM-5 notes that it\u2019s often not possible to determine exactly what volatile hydro- carbon is responsible for inhalant use disorder, and recommends using the general term inhalant use disorder whenever you aren\u2019t certain. Of course, if the principal compo - nent of, say, glue is toluene, then you\u2019d go with toluene use disorder. Nitrous oxide and any of the nitrites (amyl, butyl, isobutyl) are considered to be other (or unknown) sub - stances, and a use disorder involving any of these is coded accordingly. Inhalant use disorder is pretty uncommon, even among the primary user group: teenage boys. It tends to remit spontaneously, giving way to other substances and vari- ous other mental disorders. Of course, for some, the end stage is death from various breathing- related catastrophes. Inhalant Intoxication People with inhalant intoxication are rarely encountered in emergency rooms or medi- cal offices (though they\u2019re occasionally found in morgues). Many of their symptoms are similar to those of people with alcohol intoxication. Early symptoms include drowsi - ness, agitation, lightheadedness, and disinhibition. Later on, they may develop ataxia, disorientation, and dizziness. More severe intoxication produces insomnia, weakness, trouble speaking, disruptive behavior, and occasionally hallucinations. After a period of sleep, a user will often be lethargic and feel hung over. Toluene, a widely used solvent, is a principal component of many of the substances abused. It is associated with headache, high mood, giddiness, and cerebellar ataxia (irregular, uncoordinated movements often accompanied by poor balance, walking with feet wide apart, and staggering). With smaller doses, there may be fatigue, head - ache, inhibited reflexes, and tingling sensations. Inhalants are usually absorbed by bagging or by huffing . When bagging, people spray, squeeze, or pour the contents into a plastic bag and then inhale from the bag. They huff by placing substance- soaked rags into their mouths and inhaling. Either method can sustain a high that lasts for hours. When you are evaluating someone you suspect of using inhalants, be sure to ask carefully about all other substance classes. The use of multiple substances is common in 436 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS these patients, whose symptoms may be due in part to the use of alcohol, cannabis, hal- lucinogens, or tobacco. The only sure way to determine what a patient has been using is chemical analysis for substances",

The only sure way to determine what a patient has been using is chemical analysis for substances in the patient\u2019s blood or urine. Essential Features of Inhalant Intoxication Upon inhaling a chemical substance, the patient experiences poor judgment, aggres- sion, or other behavior changes, plus various symptoms of neuromuscular incoordina- tion: trouble walking, lightheadedness, slow reflexes, trembling, weakness, blurred or double vision, drowsiness, jerking eye movements called nystagmus, unclear speech.

Dudley Langenegger Since he was 12, Dudley Langenegger had been in trouble for running away, for break- ing and entering, and for something he didn\u2019t understand they called \u201cincorrigibility.\u201d Days before his 18th birthday, the judge had given him a choice: \u201cJail or the military.\u201d Now he\u2019d been in the Army for 6 months, just long enough to finish basic training. Even when he was clean and sober, which wasn\u2019t often, Dudley hadn\u2019t been an espe - cially good soldier. Often insolent, he was only compliant enough to spend most of his weekends confined to base rather than the stockade. When his unit boarded a ship for its joint operation with the Navy, Dudley went along. So, apparently, did several tubes of model airplane cement. At least that was what Dudley said he had been huffing in the galley at midnight. As he told his story, he required several sharp commands and at least one good shaking from the first sergeant to keep him from wandering off the subject or falling asleep. His breath smelled like a paint shop. Dudley had been inhaling various vapors, mainly organic solvents, for about 3 years. Where he grew up, a lot of the guys did this; the stuff was easy to get, cheap, even legal. He admitted that the issue of legality didn\u2019t weigh heavily upon him, but cost and ease of acquisition were important. Airplane glue produced a quick, reliable high. Dudley liked it because it raised his mood and made long hours seem to flash by. Tonight he\u2019d",

Airplane glue produced a quick, reliable high. Dudley liked it because it raised his mood and made long hours seem to flash by. Tonight he\u2019d had his own private party. Everyone else had gone to bed, and he wanted to boost himself out of the low mood he Inhalant Intoxication 437 had been in. It had worked so well that he had thought that it might be a good idea to throw pots and pans around in the galley, which was how the military police had found him. The sea was calm when Dudley was escorted to the brig, but he stumbled, swayed, and almost fell onto the bunk. He rubbed his eyes, which were already brick-red, and seemed to be trying to determine where he was. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be the barracks,\u201d he said with a giggle, \u201cthere\u2019s no Playmate posters on the wall.\u201d \u201cI never use it more than once or twice a week,\u201d he said with another giggle. \u201cToo musha stays vits s\u2019posed, uh, bad for your brain.\u201d Evaluation of Dudley Langenegger As a result of sniffing glue, Dudley had the bad judgment (criterion B) to throw things in the galley; the giggling suggested maladaptive emotional changes. In addition to the obvious ill timing of his drug use, he had a number of the physical symptoms of inhal - ant intoxication. These included slurred speech (C4), lethargy (his first sergeant had to keep him awake during the interview\u2014C6), and poor coordination (C3). The giggling would suggest euphoria (C13), but we\u2019d want a direct question about his mood to be sure. His eyes were irritated, and he had the odor of solvents on his breath. (A physical examination might well have revealed nystagmus and depressed reflexes as well; how- ever, only two of these numerous symptoms are required for a diagnosis.) The differential diagnosis would include use of other drugs such as alcohol ; the history is usually sufficient to discriminate these causes, and the odor of airplane glue on the patient\u2019s breath can be a dead giveaway. Various neurological conditions (such as multiple sclerosis) must also be ruled out (D). Dudley came close to fulfilling criteria for inhalant intoxication delirium.

    "the odor of airplane glue on the patient\u2019s breath can be a dead giveaway. Various neurological conditions (such as multiple sclerosis) must also be ruled out (D). Dudley came close to fulfilling criteria for inhalant intoxication delirium. When apprehended and interviewed, he was obviously less than fully alert and could not sus- tain attention without a lot of direction from his first sergeant. He was also disoriented (he didn\u2019t know where he was), and he couldn\u2019t speak clearly. However, we\u2019d only diag- nose delirium if his impairment lasted longer than expected for an intoxication and if it independently required clinical attention. Would Dudley qualify for a diagnosis of inhalant use disorder ? That judgment would require some extrapolation on the part of his clinician. Huffing had certainly interfered with Dudley\u2019s work (substance use disorder criterion A4), but there is little direct evidence that other criteria had been met. His problems with fights, poor work performance, and the legal system might be related to his use of inhalants, but they could also be attributed to a personality disorder. (There isn\u2019t enough information for one of those diagnoses, either. This should be explored later.) No one seems to have thought to ask him whether he craved inhalants. Though we might infer a strong desire to use them from his behavior, it would remain just that: an inference. Although he con- tinued to use these drugs despite evidence of psychological or physical problems, did he know this? Again, we could only infer, as we would with the question of how much time he spent obtaining and using inhalants. 438 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS All in all, the farthest I\u2019d go is to call Dudley\u2019s a provisional case of inhalant use disorder. After all, the criteria are meant to guide, not impede us as we navigate the diagnostic shoals. Dudley\u2019s 3-year history, with attendant difficulties, would seem enough to sustain the diagnosis. With too few definite criteria nailed down, however, I\u2019d call it of moderate intensity\u2014and interview him hard, when he had improved, for more information. I\u2019d note in the case summary that I could make no diagnosis of a personality disorder, but that he had antisocial personality traits. He\u2019d also had some symptoms suggestive of conduct disorder, but they\u2019d require further exploration to make a retrospective diagnosis.

We don\u2019t, so Dudley\u2019s com- plete diagnosis (with a GAF score of 40) would be as follows: F18.229 [304.60, 292.89] Moderate inhalant use disorder (provisional), with inhalant intoxication Z65.3 [V62.5] Arrested by MPs Other Inhalant- Induced Disorders You will find a complete listing of inhalant- induced disorders in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. F18.99 [292.9] Unspecified Inhalant- Related Disorder Opioid- related Disorders Years ago, opioids were the most feared of the mind- altering substances. (Cocaine has long since assumed that distinction.) In terms of human wastage and criminal activ - ity, however, opioids are still among the most costly of illegal drugs. Users can spend several hundred dollars a day on their habits, mostly obtained through criminal activ - ity. Of the opioid drugs, heroin remains the worst of a bad lot\u2014far ahead of any other substance in terms of both physical harm and addictive potential. Opioid users value their drugs because of the high, which they experience as euphoria and diminished concern for the present. Heroin has several times the power of morphine to produce euphoria and to blunt the perception of pain, to the point that users become indifferent to pain. First-time opioid users, on the other hand, often expe- rience vomiting and dysphoria. Some users, especially those who are middle-class and middle-aged, may start to abuse opioids during the course of medical treatment. Ready access to drugs places health care professionals at special risk for opioid use. However, most users begin in their teens or 20s as a result of peer pressure. Opioid use is generally preceded by the use of other drugs, such as alcohol or marijuana. In this group, risk factors for opioid Opioid- related Disorders 439 use include low socioeconomic status, residence in an urban area, divorced parents, and relatives who abuse alcohol.

    "divorced parents, and relatives who abuse alcohol. Some degree of tolerance to any opioid drug develops within the first few doses; then the lives of users quickly become dominated by the pursuit and consumption of the drug. However, it remains unclear why some people exposed to narcotics become addicted and others do not. Once hooked, users go to nearly any length to obtain drugs. They will plead, steal, lie, and promise you just about anything in the world. Overall, there is under a half percent lifetime prevalence of severe opioid use in the adult population, with rates falling off in older age cohorts. Males outnumber females by about 3:2. Even after detoxification, once opioid users return to familiar environments, many begin to use again; usually this occurs within 3 months. But of those who live long enough, a substantial number eventually shake off their addiction. Most users of heroin inject the drug intravenously, and half or more of these users test positive for HIV or hepatitis C. These are important considerations for clinicians who work with this population. Needle marks indicate the injection of heroin or \u201cspeed- balls\u201d (mixed heroin and cocaine). From all sources (overdose, violence, and associated illness), the overall mortality among active heroin users approaches 2% per year. Some writers interpret the fact that users of \u201chard\u201d drugs often begin with alcohol and marijuana as denoting what they call a \u201cgateway effect,\u201d meaning that the latter drugs lead to opioid addiction. That conclusion could be correct, but after years of research, no one yet is sure whether it is. It is still entirely possible that some hereditary or environ - mental precursor leads to a variety of behaviors, including the use of alcohol, marijuana, and opioids. Opioid Use Disorder The characteristics of this disorder are similar to those of all other specific substance use disorders. The features are those for a generic substance use disorder (p. 396); cod- ing is given in detail in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. Opioid Intoxication When an opioid drug is injected, its effects are felt almost immediately. This \u201crush,\u201d which has been compared to an orgasm, is rapidly followed (depending on the indi - vidual) by euphoria, drowsiness, the perception of warmth, dry mouth, and heaviness in the extremities. Some users experience a flushed face and itching nose. In contrast to cocaine intoxication, violence is rare during opioid intoxication. Opioid intoxication can",

Some users experience a flushed face and itching nose. In contrast to cocaine intoxication, violence is rare during opioid intoxication. Opioid intoxication can sometimes be confused with sedative or alcohol intoxica - tion. The typical presence of extremely constricted (pinpoint) pupils can help make the distinction; however, pupils can dilate in severe overdose. Once again, a urine or 440 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS blood test may be necessary to differentiate among the various possible causes of an individual\u2019s symptoms. Although opioid users often become tolerant to enormous quantities, overdose with opioids is always a medical emergency. It can produce clouding of conscious - ness (including coma), severe respiratory depression, shock, and ultimately death from anoxia. Opioid overdose is treated intravenously with naloxone, a potent opioid antago- nist. Patients who use opioid drugs often wear dark glasses. Sometimes this is the fash- ion of their culture; sometimes they do it to hide their pupils. When you interview opioid users, ask them to remove dark glasses. Other physical stigmata of opioid use include scarring of the arms and of just about any other location where veins are promi- nent enough to inject drugs. The subcutaneous route of administration, called \u201cskin popping,\u201d is a last resort for those who have already destroyed their accessible veins by years of needle use. Essential Features of Opioid Intoxication Shortly after using an opioid, the patient experiences mood changes (first elation, later apathy), increased or reduced psychomotor activity, or poor judgment. Then come constricted \u201cpinpoint\u201d pupils (or dilated pupils, in overdose) along with evi - dence of depressed neurological functioning: lethargy, unclear speech, wandering attention, or poor memory.

    "ICD-10 depends on the presence of perceptual disturbances; see Table 15.2. Herm Cry Herm Cry was admitted to the detox unit 24 hours after he last shot up. The junk had been good- quality\u2014he knew, because afterwards he had slept for nearly 8 hours. But then he awakened to the all-too- familiar aching muscles and runny nose that told him it was time to go out and earn his next fix. He had had no regular job for at least a year, but he knew some ways of getting money that didn\u2019t involve waiting for a paycheck. At a young age, Herm had become familiar with the symptoms of withdrawal. His Opioid Intoxication 441 father\u2019s drinking was well known in their working-class St. Louis neighborhood. By the time he was 10, Herm had watched his father suffer through at least two episodes of DTs. Alcohol had never done much for Herm. He didn\u2019t care for the taste, and he certainly didn\u2019t need the hangover. His mother, a public health nurse, had her own problems with Demerol. Off and on since he was 12, Herm had smoked marijuana. But it wasn\u2019t until a neighborhood block party the night he turned 16 that he first snorted heroin. \u201cAll of a sudden,\u201d he told his most recent clinician, \u201cI knew I\u2019d found the way.\u201d Within a few minutes, Herm had felt happier than ever before in his life. It was as if a warm bath had leached out all the anger, depression, and anxiety he had ever contained. For a few hours, he even forgot how much he hated his old man. All he had left was an overwhelming sense of tranquility that gradually gave way to drowsy apathy. The following day, using a sterile syringe he stole from his mother, Herm injected heroin for the first time. Almost immediately, he vomited; this was followed at once by a sense of pleasure that seemed to race outward to the tips of his fingers and toes. Rubbing his itching nose, he fell asleep. When he aroused himself, several hours had passed. He injected again, using a smaller quantity of the drug (all he had left). When he awakened this time, he briefly considered stopping. His next thought was the realiza - tion that, more than anything else he could remember, he wanted to use heroin again. Evaluation of Herm Cry The sense of tranquility",
    "using a smaller quantity of the drug (all he had left). When he awakened this time, he briefly considered stopping. His next thought was the realiza - tion that, more than anything else he could remember, he wanted to use heroin again. Evaluation of Herm Cry The sense of tranquility and peace that Herm experienced (criterion B) after inject - ing heroin (A) is what causes people to return to the drug after the first time, even if it has made them sick. Of course, after they have used it for a few days, they no longer need a positive reason; simply avoiding the curse of withdrawal is enough motivation to continue. Herm also had at least one typical symptom of opioid intoxication: profound drows- iness that lasted for several hours after injecting (intoxication\u2014C1). (The runny nose and aching muscles are symptoms of the impending withdrawal. See the next vignette, which continues Herm\u2019s story.) Criterion C also requires that the patient have pinpoint pupils. These are sometimes so pronounced that the user cannot see clearly. Patients are unlikely to complain about this feature, so the diagnosis of opioid intoxication requires us to observe it. Assuming that Herm had constricted pupils and that no other mental disorder or physical illness better explained his symptoms (D), criteria for opioid intoxication would be fulfilled. Most opioid users meet criteria for a comorbid mental disorder. These include mood disorders (up to 75%), alcohol- related disorders (about 30%), antisocial per - sonality disorder (25%), and the anxiety disorders (12%). Up to 13% of opioid users attempt suicide\u2014small wonder, considering their situation. Because there is very little material in this first vignette pertaining to the issue of personality disorder, we\u2019d have to defer that diagnosis for Herm. I\u2019d phrase my note in the summary so as to alert future clinicians to the possibility, without prejudicing 442 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS them as to its nature. He would also seem a likely candidate for problems with the legal system, but the first vignette includes no such evidence. Although we already have evidence of craving, much of the material that would qualify Herm for a diagnosis of opioid use disorder is contained in the next vignette. So at this point, for coding purposes, we\u2019ll pretend he has no use disorder. With no percep- tual disturbances (see Table 15.2), his diagnosis would be simply this: F11.929 [292.89] Opioid",

With no percep- tual disturbances (see Table 15.2), his diagnosis would be simply this: F11.929 [292.89] Opioid intoxication Opioid Withdrawal Although some symptoms of opioid withdrawal may appear after a very few doses, it takes a week or two of continuous use to produce the typical withdrawal syndrome. Opioid withdrawal strongly resembles a flu-like viral illness: nausea and vomiting, dysphoria, muscle aches and pains, watery eyes and runny nose, fever, and diarrhea. Another symptom of autonomic nervous system activation that occurs during with - drawal is piloerection: Small hairs stand up, producing \u201cgoose flesh.\u201d (This is the origin of the term \u201cgoing cold turkey.\u201d) How rapidly symptoms of withdrawal appear depends principally on which drug is used; consult a reference on opioids (or search the Internet) for information about the half-lives of specific drugs. Even after most of the symptoms have abated, some patients may suffer a protracted abstinence syndrome, characterized by anxiety and low self- esteem, that can last as long as 5 or 6 months. Essential Features of Opioid Withdrawal After cutting back from several weeks of heavy opioid use, the patient develops characteristic symptoms of rebound excitation\u2014 dysphoria, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, tearing (runny nose), yawning, sleeplessness, and autonomic symptoms such as dilated pupils, hairs standing up, and sweating.

His usual suppliers had refused to extend him credit. He had tried to borrow money from his mother, but she had refused, and the earrings he\u2019d stolen from her dresser top had proven worthless. Although the abdominal cramps were worsening and he felt nauseated, he managed to make it to the apartment of a former girlfriend for whom he had briefly pimped. But she had just shot up the last",
    "had refused, and the earrings he\u2019d stolen from her dresser top had proven worthless. Although the abdominal cramps were worsening and he felt nauseated, he managed to make it to the apartment of a former girlfriend for whom he had briefly pimped. But she had just shot up the last of her own stash and was asleep. He appropriated her used syringe for his own use later, in case he scored. Ducking into a restroom in the bus station, Herm narrowly averted the disastrous consequences from a bout of explosive diarrhea. As he was about to emerge from the stall, he suddenly retched into the grimy toilet bowl. He sat down on the cool tile floor and tried to rub away the goose flesh on his arm. He dabbed at his runny nose with a bit of toilet paper. He was too weak, he realized, to hustle. He would have to enter detox for a few days and get his strength back. Then he could go out and get what he really needed to make him well. Further Evaluation of Herm Cry Earlier, Herm had awakened to muscle cramps and a runny nose\u2014 typical early symp- toms (criteria B3, B4) of opioid withdrawal. As the day went on and he could not obtain more heroin (A1), he developed gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (B2, B6). He had goose flesh (B5), and by the time he was admitted, a clini - cian would also probably find dilated pupils. (Just three symptoms from criterion B are needed for a diagnosis of withdrawal.) On the basis of the symptoms related in the two vignettes, we should also give Herm a diagnosis of opioid use disorder. Of course, he suffered from withdrawal (sub- stance use disorder criterion A11). Herm\u2019s most notable behavioral symptom was the impairment in his normal functioning (for a year or more, he had forsaken work for criminal activities\u2014A7). He spent a great deal of time trying to obtain heroin (A3), and he had had no job for a year or more (A6), in part because his drug habit fully occupied his time. Craving for the drug is almost universal in addicted individuals who have, like Herm, suddenly stopped using (A4); we\u2019ve noted it in the first vignette. He probably met other criteria for opioid use disorder as well, such as tolerance and attempts to quit, but these are",

He probably met other criteria for opioid use disorder as well, such as tolerance and attempts to quit, but these are not addressed in the vignette. Even so, we can agree that Herm was probably severely dependent. Table 15.2 spells out the coding for ICD-10. For ICD-9, see Table 15.3. Because it was the main reason for Herm\u2019s entering treatment, opioid withdrawal is listed first in his diagnostic summary. Herm\u2019s personality diagnosis would not change. He had several characteristics (thievery and pimping) of antisocial personality disorder, but we don\u2019t know that these ever occurred outside the context of his substance use. That personality disorder is certainly well represented among other users of opioids, however. I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 55. 444 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS F11.23 [304.00, 292.0] Severe opioid use disorder, with withdrawal Other Opioid- Induced Disorders You will find a complete listing of opioid- related disorders in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic- related Disorders Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics are used for different purposes but share many features. Those most relevant to mental health are the symptoms of intoxication and withdrawal they have in common. The terms applied to these substances are somewhat confusing, and not always precisely used. A sedative is anything that reduces excite - ment and induces quiet without producing drowsiness. A hypnotic helps the patient get to sleep and stay there. And an anxiolytic is one that, well, reduces anxiety. Depend - ing on dose, however, most of the drugs discussed in this section can have any of these actions. The major drug classes covered in this section are the benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax), and the barbiturates, such as pentobarbital (Nembutal); other classes include the carbamates (such as meprobamate, or Miltown) and the barbiturate-like hypnotics. Users value the barbiturates and benzodiazepines for the disinhibition they produce, which means that they induce euphoria, reduce anxiety and guilt, and boost self- confidence and energy. There are two main patterns of abuse, which can be summarized roughly as follows. Some people get started with a prescription, usually obtained to combat the effects of insomnia or anxiety. Then, to varying degrees, they increase the dose. Although they would probably have",
    "and boost self- confidence and energy. There are two main patterns of abuse, which can be summarized roughly as follows. Some people get started with a prescription, usually obtained to combat the effects of insomnia or anxiety. Then, to varying degrees, they increase the dose. Although they would probably have withdrawal symptoms if they abruptly stopped using the drug, many of these people would never meet the behavioral criteria for a generic substance use disorder (p. 396). They may not even recognize, or admit to, cravings. A more frequent route to misuse occurs when (mainly young) people employ these drugs to produce euphoria. This is the history we classically associate with the misuse of most of the substances described in DSM-5. In the past, this has been especially true of the use of barbiturates and specialty drugs such as methaqualone and glutethimide. In recent years, however, the legitimate manufacture of these drugs has been either greatly curtailed (barbiturates) or banned altogether (methaqualone). Physicians\u2019 pre - scribing practices have also changed. Government regulation has been an important catalyst for these changes. Only infrequently are benzodiazepines the primary substances misused, but they are often employed to mitigate the undesired effects of other drugs\u2014for example, to calm the jitters induced by central nervous system stimulants. Benzodiazepines are also sometimes used to boost the high of methadone or to ease the symptoms of heroin with- drawal. In the early 2000s, use during the previous year of sedatives and tranquilizers ranged from 0.3% (for teenagers) downward (for older people). The benzodiazepines Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic- related Disorders 445 preferred by users are diazepam, alprazolam, and lorazepam; users will pay premium prices to be sure they are getting the real thing. Other than those with substance use disorder, mental health patients have a very low rate of abusing, say, benzodiazepines. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder The characteristics of this disorder are similar to those of nearly every other specific substance use disorder. The criteria are those for a generic substance use disorder (p. 396). Note, however, that when a drug is prescribed for medical purposes, tolerance and withdrawal are not to be used as symptoms of a use disorder. See Tables 15.2 and 15.3 for coding.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication As with most drugs, the effects achieved through the use of sedatives, hypnotics, or anx- iolytics depend strongly on the setting where they are consumed and the expectations of those who use them. Mood is often labile, with case reports ranging from euphoria to hostility and depression. Loss of memory similar to that occurring in heavy alco - hol consumption has also been reported, notoriously with flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), the so- called \u201cdate rape\u201d drug. Other common effects include unsteady gait, slurred speech, nystagmus, poor judgment, and drowsiness. In very high doses, these drugs produce respiratory depression, coma, and death, though these outcomes are far more likely with barbiturates than with the benzodiazepines. The DSM-5 criteria for this category are identical to those for alcohol intoxication. Essential Features of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication Shortly after using a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug, the patient becomes dis- inhibited (argues; is aggressive; has rapid mood shifts or impairment of attention, judgment, or personal functioning). There is also evidence of neurological impair - ment (imbalance or wobbly gait, unclear speech, poor coordination, jerking eye movements called nystagmus, reduced level of consciousness).

Four months later, on the day he hobbled out of the hospital using an aluminum walker, he began trying to fulfill that promise. What he hadn\u2019t reckoned on were the muscle spasms. Kirk was 35 when the warehouse accident happened. Despite the insulin- dependent diabetes he\u2019d had for 15 years, he considered himself healthy. His only pre- vious hospitalization had been for febrile convulsions as a child.

    "pre- vious hospitalization had been for febrile convulsions as a child. The combination of his diabetes and a strict religious upbringing had caused him to avoid street drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Until his accident, he had prided himself on never taking so much as an aspirin tablet. But the muscle spasms changed all that. They had probably been there ever since the accident, though Kirk didn\u2019t notice them until the first day he was allowed out of bed. Thereafter, any time he was up and about, he was likely to be seized with excruci- ating cramps in the muscles of his lower back. Reluctantly, he accepted a prescription for diazepam. A 5-mg tablet four times a day, his doctor assured him, would help relax his muscles. Miraculously, it worked. For nearly 2 weeks Kirk was able to move around com - fortably, if not pain-free. When the spasms returned and his doctor told him that 20 mg per day was the maximum dose he should take, he sought the advice of another doctor. Within a few months, Kirk was seeing four physicians and taking between 60 and 80 mg of diazepam every day. He saw one doctor under an assumed name (in the state where Kirk lived, the prescription of benzodiazepines was tightly controlled). The other two physicians he consulted worked across the state line, just a few miles from his house. A fifth doctor had noticed his low mood and warned him not to take too much of the drug; he had never returned to see that physician again. What with waiting for his appointments and driving to distant pharmacies, Kirk needed several hours each week just to obtain his supply. Much of the rest of his time\u2014 he hadn\u2019t yet been able to return to work, so he stayed home and kept house for his wife and two daughters\u2014he spent in front of the television set, recalling little of what he watched. His wife complained that he had changed; he had become moody and he seemed to have trouble following the thread of a conversation. Evaluation of Kirk Aufderheide Kirk\u2019s wife described him as moody, which is the sort of psychological change you\u2019d expect from diazepam intoxication (criterion B).

    "Aufderheide Kirk\u2019s wife described him as moody, which is the sort of psychological change you\u2019d expect from diazepam intoxication (criterion B). He had an unsteady gait and poor memory (for the TV he watched), two of the specific symptoms for intoxication (C3, C5). He only needed one for the diagnosis. Although the present criteria are exactly the same as for alcohol intoxication, historical information and the smell of alcohol on the breath should allow ready dis - Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication 447 crimination (D). In Kirk\u2019s case, there was no history to implicate alcohol. However, for another patient a blood test may be needed to identify use of both. Would Kirk qualify for a diagnosis of diazepam use disorder? He had developed a degree of tolerance (substance use disorder criterion B9) that caused him to take four times the maximum dose recommended\u2014far more than any one of his physicians would prescribe. He spent considerable time going to four different doctors and phar- macies to obtain his supply (B3). He also continued to use diazepam, even though one physician told him that high doses could harm him (B8). With a GAF score of 2.5, Kirk\u2019s diagnosis at this point would be as follows: F13.229 [304.10, 292.89] Moderate diazepam use disorder, with intoxication Z87.828 [V15.59] Fracture (crush) of pelvis, healed E10.9 [250.01] Type 1 diabetes without complications Z56.9 [V62.29] Unemployed Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal When a patient stops using (or markedly reduces a high dose of) a sedative/hypnotic drug, the result is much like the abrupt cessation of alcohol use; the criteria for with - drawal are identical. (In this context, a high dose means several times the therapeutic dose\u2014for example, 60 mg or more of diazepam.) However, the time course varies with the half-life of the drug. As in the case of the opioids, consult a reference on these drugs for information about a specific drug\u2019s half-life. One diagnostic challenge is to distinguish withdrawal symptoms from the reemer- gence of those symptoms that led to treatment in the first place (anxiety, agitation, and insomnia play a prominent role in both). The time course can help: Any symptoms that remain (or appear) 2\u20133 weeks after the drug has been discontinued are probably old symptoms reemerging. Essential Features of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal After heavy, long- lasting use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug, the patient suddenly stops or",

Kirk Aufderheide Again Four days short of the first anniversary of his accident, Kirk\u2019s wife received notice that she was being transferred to a branch office in the interior of the state. The transfer forced the family to move. At their new location, Kirk encountered tighter controls on the prescription of benzodiazepines, together with far fewer physicians and pharma - cies. Once they had settled into their new home, he realized that he had no choice but to reduce his dose of diazepam. Although Kirk intended to taper his usage, he put it off until he was nearly out of medication. So on a warm summer morning he found himself suddenly facing the prospect of taking only 4 tablets, whereas the day before he had had 16. At first, he was surprised at how little it bothered him. For several days he experienced insomnia, but he had expected that. (With no work to go to, he had had time to read some magazine articles about the effects of substance use.) But at 4 a.m. of the third day, Kirk awakened to a sense of anxiety that bordered on panic. He felt nauseated and noticed that his pulse was racing. For 2 days",
    "to go to, he had had time to read some magazine articles about the effects of substance use.) But at 4 a.m. of the third day, Kirk awakened to a sense of anxiety that bordered on panic. He felt nauseated and noticed that his pulse was racing. For 2 days his agita- tion mounted, to such an extent that he had difficulty sitting still long enough to eat the supper he had prepared. On the fifth day, his wife arrived home to find him having a grand mal seizure. Further Evaluation of Kirk Aufderheide When he drastically decreased his intake of diazepam (criterion A), Kirk noted some of the classic symptoms (two are required) of withdrawal: racing pulse, insomnia, and nausea (B1, B3, B4). (Diazepam\u2019s relatively long half-life meant that it took quite some time for withdrawal symptoms to develop.) Childhood febrile seizures might have made him more susceptible to withdrawal seizures; Kirk\u2019s occurred within a few days (B8)\u2014 the fate of perhaps one- fourth of people who abruptly withdraw from these substances. His impairment could go without saying (C). Anxiety and panic attacks commonly occur as rebound phenomena; therefore, anxiety disorders form an important part of the differential diagnosis (D). When hal - lucinations occur during withdrawal, they can be mistaken for a manic episode or vari- Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal 449 ous psychotic disorders. Delirium is also a relatively common complication. Antisocial personality disorder is often encountered among patients who obtain these medica - tions illegally. Kirk had had no illusions or hallucinations to qualify for the specifier of with per - ceptual disturbances. Because the seizure was the focus of treatment on admission, I\u2019ve listed it first. The rest of his diagnosis remains as it was before. R56.9 [780.39] Withdrawal seizure F13.239 [304.10, 292.0] Moderate diazepam use disorder, with withdrawal Other Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic- Induced Disorders You will find a complete listing of these disorders in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. I\u2019ll briefly mention one of these: Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium. When delirium occurs, it is almost always within a week of the patient\u2019s discontinuing a drug. Like delirium due to other causes, it features reduced attention span and problems with orienta- tion, memory, perception (visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations or illusions) or language disturbance. It is usually preceded by insomnia. F13.99 [292.9] Unspecified Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic- Related Disorder Stimulant- related Disorders Stimulants",
    "discontinuing a drug. Like delirium due to other causes, it features reduced attention span and problems with orienta- tion, memory, perception (visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations or illusions) or language disturbance. It is usually preceded by insomnia. F13.99 [292.9] Unspecified Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic- Related Disorder Stimulant- related Disorders Stimulants (sometimes called psychostimulants) affect mental or physical functioning, or both. For example, these drugs typically improve\u2014at least for a time\u2014 alertness, mood, and activity levels. Worldwide, some stimulants are used by prescription to ame- liorate the effects of both mental and physical disorders. In addition, many are used, and misused, recreationally. Although caffeine is also a stimulant, it occupies its own niche among psychoactive drugs. DSM-5 mentions two main types of stimulants: amphetamines and cocaine. In previous editions, though the symptoms for intoxication and withdrawal are identical for these two drug classes, they occupied separate sections. Now, with commendable logic, they have been combined. Still, their patterns of use are different enough that I\u2019ve continued to provide two sets of vignettes as illustrations. Amphetamines and Related Compounds Abusers value amphetamines (the international spelling is amfetamines) for the eupho- ria, appetite suppression, and increase in energy they provide. Although many peo - 450 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS ple begin amphetamine use by snorting, blood vessel constriction in the nose makes absorption unpredictable, so other routes are sought. Smoking or injection produces a rapid effect, such that binge users take the drug repeatedly for half a day to 2\u20133 days. Effects of the drug fall off rapidly as tolerance develops. It is almost inevitable that a period of nonuse will occur, but users remember how \u201cwonderful\u201d the drug was (that\u2019s the euphoria talking) and want more. This institutes a cycle of use and withdrawal that usually lasts about 10 days. Amphetamine users tend to look sleep- deprived and anorectic. Physical signs include circles under the eyes, poor hygiene, and dry, itchy skin that is prone to acne- like lesions. Users who inject can get vasoconstriction at the site, with necrosis of skin. Those who inhale may develop nosebleeds, even perforated nasal septum. Toxic symp- toms include chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath. When they were first synthesized in 1887, no regulations limited amphetamine use.

    "septum. Toxic symp- toms include chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath. When they were first synthesized in 1887, no regulations limited amphetamine use. Through the middle years of the 20th century, it was commonplace to use them for weight control, depression, and nasal stuffiness; they were widely abused in the 1960s and into the 1970s. Since then, however, tight controls and changing prescription practices have greatly reduced their availability. Virtually their only legitimate uses now are to treat obesity, narcolepsy, some depressive disorders, and attention- deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. Amphetamines may be taken intermittently at relatively modest doses by truck - ers, students, and others (most are young men) who want something beyond caffeine to keep them awake. Some users take these drugs to produce euphoria, often leading to \u201cspeed runs\u201d that can last for weeks. There may be episodes of delirium during these runs and \u201ccrashes\u201d when the supply runs out. Others use stimulants to counterbalance the effects of sedatives and other drugs of abuse. Only about 2% of emergency room drug- related visits are due to amphetamines and their related substances. The prevalence among high- school age youngsters is around 2 per 1,000, pretty close to that for cocaine. Some data suggest that those dependent on amphetamines may stop using them after a decade or so. The substances related to amphetamine that are available by prescription include methamphetamine (Desoxyn), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), amphetamine combinations (Adderall), diethylopro - pion (Tenuate), and methylphenidate (Ritalin). Illicit methamphetamine can be synthe- sized in small batches, but much of the product available in the United States is made in laboratories, either domestic or Mexican. Ecstasy (MDM a) has structural similarities to both amphetamines and mescaline, one of the hallucinogens, and its effects are both stimulant and mildly psychedelic. It\u2019s been around for a hundred years; nearly 4% of a mericans have tried it. It is rarely used every day; rather, its typical use occurs at \u201craves\u201d and in other social situations. although it has a terrible reputation for causing physical harm and addiction, it rates somewhere near the lower end of the scale, according to a study published in The Lancet in 2007. Stimulant- related Disorders 451 Cocaine Cocaine has filled a good part of the niche once occupied by amphetamines.

    "to a study published in The Lancet in 2007. Stimulant- related Disorders 451 Cocaine Cocaine has filled a good part of the niche once occupied by amphetamines. (The effects of cocaine are nearly identical to those of amphetamines, but half-life in the body is much briefer. This may explain cocaine\u2019s greater addicting powers\u2014and appeal.) With a short half-life, cocaine creates powerful craving, and users will use it more frequently than is the case for amphetamines. Also, toxic symptoms are briefer than for amphetamines. Severe intoxication includes convulsions, heartbeat irregularities, high fever, and death. Paranoid thinking can increase as the binge goes on. Delusions (often of plots or attack on the user) are usually self- limited and brief (a matter of hours). Perceptual distortions occur; hallucinations are rare. Long out of fashion after a brief spurt of popularity in the early 1900s, cocaine enjoyed a resurgence when the U.S. government clamped down on the manufacture and distribution of amphetamines during the 1970s. Since then, plummeting cost and skyrocketing availability have made it the second most frequently used illicit drug (behind marijuana) in the United States and worldwide. In recent years, about a quar - ter of drug- related visits to emergency rooms have been due to cocaine. Concentrated among younger adults (age 15\u201334), men more than women tend to be afflicted by this scourge. Those who use have 4\u20138 times the expected mortality of their nonusing peers. Cocaine that has been heated with bicarbonate yields a white lump that is not destroyed by heating. It produces a popping sound when smoked; hence the name crack. The availability of crack accounted for much of the rise in cocaine use during the latter part of the 20th century; however, the number of users may have declined somewhat during the first decade of the 21st century. Most users of cocaine begin by taking it intermittently, but will rapidly progress to \u201cruns\u201d similar to those of amphetamine users. Addiction to crack cocaine usually occurs after only a few weeks of use. Because almost no tolerance to cocaine develops, runs can continue for several days, though a day or less is more usual. Note that the cross- sectional evaluation may not adequately discriminate patients who use cocaine from those who use amphetamines or related drugs. Even history can be unreliable: What is sold on the streets doesn\u2019t always match what\u2019s advertised. Even the more reliable purveyors",
    "a day or less is more usual. Note that the cross- sectional evaluation may not adequately discriminate patients who use cocaine from those who use amphetamines or related drugs. Even history can be unreliable: What is sold on the streets doesn\u2019t always match what\u2019s advertised. Even the more reliable purveyors have little control over impurities or contaminants. The only sure way to determine what substance a patient is using is to obtain a urine or blood specimen for toxicology. Khat An African plant called khat contains an alkaloid, cathinone, which breaks down into ephedrine. Indigenous people (in Yemen, for example) chew the leaves for the effect of euphoria and excitement, similar to a strong brew of coffee. A mild withdrawal syn - drome can occur. It ranks near the bottom of the stimulants for physical harm and addiction potential, though mild psychoses and hypomanic states have been reported. 452 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS \u201cBath Salts\u201d Relatively new are so- called \u201cbath salts,\u201d often marketed \u201cnot for human consumption\u201d in an effort to evade state and federal drug laws. These compounds, variously named and sold online or in head shops as an alternative to cocaine, usually contain a version of cathinone (the alkaloid in khat) that\u2019s been fiddled with chemically. The powerful inhi- bition of monoamine reuptake leads to a variety of physical and mental symptoms\u2014 delirium, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, agitation, rapid heartbeat, blood pressure elevation, fever, and seizures. Withdrawal can lead to profound craving; overdose can mean death. Users tend to be male and relatively young (20s). Since 2011, bath salts have been illegal in the United States. Stimulant Use Disorder The characteristics of stimulant use disorder are similar to those of nearly every other specific substance use disorder. The criteria are those for a generic substance use disor- der (p. 396). I\u2019ve listed the coding stuff in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. But you probably know that by now. Stimulant Intoxication DSM-5 has mashed together amphetamine and cocaine use syndromes, but there are enough differences that they deserve to be discussed separately anyway. The Essential Features of intoxication and withdrawal are the same for both, however. Essential Features of Stimulant Intoxication Shortly after using a stimulant drug, the patient exhibits changes of mood/affect, as well as impaired judgment or psychosocial functioning. In addition, there will be physical indicators of neurological excitation: lowered or raised blood pressure, heart rate, and",
    "withdrawal are the same for both, however. Essential Features of Stimulant Intoxication Shortly after using a stimulant drug, the patient exhibits changes of mood/affect, as well as impaired judgment or psychosocial functioning. In addition, there will be physical indicators of neurological excitation: lowered or raised blood pressure, heart rate, and motor activity; dilated pupils; sweating or chills; nausea; anorexia; and weakness, chest pain, respiratory depression, or irregular heartbeat. Very ill patients may experience seizures, coma, or perplexity. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration to onset of symptoms (within minutes) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (physical illness, other mental disorders) You can find the specifics of stimulant intoxication in Table 15.1. Stimulant Intoxication 453 Coding Notes Specify if: With perceptual disturbances. The patient has altered perceptions: audi - tory, tactile, or visual illusions or hallucinations with intact insight (the patient rec - ognizes that the symptoms are unreal, caused by the substance use). Hallucinations without this insight suggest a diagnosis of stimulant- induced psychotic disorder. When recording, specify the stimulant by name. Coding in ICD-10 depends on the presence of perceptual disturbances; see Table 15.2. Amphetamine Intoxication If an amphetamine is injected, feelings of euphoria, confidence, and well-being begin quickly. Users experience a \u201crush\u201d of energy and euphoria; they find their own thoughts profound, and their sexual interest picks up. But they pay the price of anorexia and agitation. When the intoxication is severe, they become confused and their speech rambles. With longer use, the person may begin to withdraw from other people and focus more or less exclusively on obtaining and using drugs. Hallucinations (such as bugs crawling on the skin) or paranoid ideas can develop. Delirium may be accompanied by violence. Some people adopt stereotyped behaviors: ritualistic reenactments of things they normally like to do (such as assembling and dismantling electronic equipment). Any of these syndromes can resemble schizophrenia, but the alert clinician will focus on the longitudinal history as obtained from informants. Laboratory studies help con - firm the toxic origins of the behavior. Freeman Cooke \u201cI was hyperactive when I was a child,\u201d said Freeman Cooke to the interviewer. \u201cMy mother used to give me coffee to slow me down.\u201d Moving restlessly around the office, Freeman looked as if he\u2019d just had several cups too many.

    "interviewer. \u201cMy mother used to give me coffee to slow me down.\u201d Moving restlessly around the office, Freeman looked as if he\u2019d just had several cups too many. He had already twice excused himself to the bathroom, where he nearly threw up. The nurse who checked him had noted that his blood pressure was up, and that his pulse was racing along at 132 beats per minute. He admitted that he had snorted a half gram of \u201ccrystal meth\u201d not long before coming to the office. Freeman was the oldest of four children. His mother had been an unhappy, ner - vous woman who always seemed unwell. His father made good money as a finish car - penter, but his appetite for vodka grew as his family increased. When still a child, Free- man had promised himself that he would avoid alcohol and treat his wife, if he ever had one, with more respect than his father had done. He managed to keep half his promise. After completing high school, Freeman got married and obtained a job as a helper with a long- distance moving company. The pay was good, but the hours were awful. 454 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS When he and his boss were on the road, they sometimes worked 18 hours straight. Like most of the other truckers, he used dextroamphetamine to pep him up and keep him awake. At first, he took them only when he was working. When he came home from a 10-day trip, he would \u201ccrash and burn,\u201d sometimes sleeping as long as 20 hours at a stretch. But by the time he had enough seniority and experience to buy his own truck, he was using amphetamines recreationally, too. Freeman had started to snort powdered methamphetamine (\u201cmeth\u201d), but he rap - idly switched to smoking because it gave him a better \u201cflash.\u201d When he was high, he felt insanely happy, tireless, and powerful. \u201cLike I could lift a grand piano, all by myself,\u201d he explained. He also developed the tendency to argue, and would sometimes keep his wife up late at night with a tirade about matters that the next day even he found trivial. After a few hours, as the effect of the high began to wear off and only the memory of the flash remained, he felt driven to smoke up again and again. But with each use dur- ing",
    "with a tirade about matters that the next day even he found trivial. After a few hours, as the effect of the high began to wear off and only the memory of the flash remained, he felt driven to smoke up again and again. But with each use dur- ing a run, it took more of the drug to produce the flash. Eventually, either his supply or his constitution would give out, and he would once again crash and burn. When he struggled back to consciousness, he was often astonished at how much of the stuff he had consumed. When Freeman awakened after an unusually memorable 2-day run, he found a note saying that his wife was leaving him. For the first time, he realized how exactly like his father he had become. Evaluation of Freeman Cooke Like all other types of substance intoxication, stimulant intoxication must be docu - mented with marked, detrimental behavioral or psychological changes (criterion B). For Freeman, that would be easy: His recent use (A) had led to arguments with his wife, which culminated in her departure. Of the physical signs and symptoms (two required), he had elevated pulse and blood pressure (C1, C3) as well as agitation and nausea (C7, C5). At evaluation, he had no hallucinations or illusions that would qualify for the per- ceptual disturbances specifier. Freeman also qualified for a diagnosis of amphetamine use disorder. Requiring more of the drug to achieve a high on successive occasions of use, he clearly experi - enced tolerance (A10). He sometimes used more methamphetamine than he intended (A1), and he spent a great deal of time and energy in using it and recovering from the effects (A3). The judgment that his use pattern was severe is based in part on evidence of amphetamine withdrawal (A11), discussed below, though I would also claim clini - cian\u2019s privilege in asserting that he was seriously dependent. I\u2019d give him a GAF score of 55.

    "strongest pharmacological reinforcer ever devised. Laboratory animals will choose it in preference to food, water, and sex; given free access, they will use it again and again until they die. Humans use it by snorting, injecting, or smoking. Smoking crack can produce a rush of euphoria and a feeling of well-being that begins within seconds. The user feels alert and self- confident, and has increased sexual desire. These positive feelings last for a few minutes, then give way to dysphoria and an intense craving for more of the drug. With continuing use, the euphoric effects lessen and the dysphoria (anxiety, depression, fatigue) takes over. Motivation is bent to a single goal: obtaining more cocaine. Behavioral changes associated with cocaine intoxication include aggression and agitation, often leading to fighting and hypervigilance. Cocaine postpones fatigue, and the resulting increase in energy breeds impaired judgment and an increased willing - ness to take risks. Violence and crime are frequent products of the cocaine- intoxicated state. Cognitive symptoms include delusions, feelings of omnipotence, ideas of reference (beliefs that external events have a special meaning unique to oneself), and haptic (tac- tile) hallucinations. Other symptoms include irritability, increased sensory awareness, anorexia, insomnia, and spontaneous ejaculation. If the intoxication is severe, there may be rambling speech, perplexity, anxiety, headache, and palpitations of the heart. Amanda Brandt Since her graduation from college at age 22, Amanda Brandt had worked as a futures trader on the Chicago Stock Exchange. It was a fast-paced, high- pressured life, and she loved it. \u201cI was an economics major in college,\u201d she explained, \u201cand what can you do with that? Teach?\u201d Futures trading exactly suited Amanda\u2019s temperament. Since early high school, she had been energetic and outgoing. Her job introduced her to a lot of young people who were as bright and well paid as she. Amanda\u2019s father was a Baptist minister; he and her mother were both teetotalers. Though both of her grandfathers were long dead, Amanda thought that they had suf - fered from alcoholism. She supposed that this might have had something to do with her parents\u2019 attitude toward alcohol. \u201cI\u2019m sure they never dreamed I smoked pot in college,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it never seemed to bother me, and it was the social thing to do.\u201d What was social in her corner of the Exchange, she soon discovered, was cocaine.

She and her fellow traders made more than enough money to afford quantities of the powdery stuff, though not as much as they actually used. With the advent of crack, the price decreased, and Amanda\u2019s use soared. She had always hated the pain of needles, so instead of snorting, she learned to smoke it. \u201cWithin a few seconds of lighting up, you felt wonderful. It was like a total body climax,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like even my lungs were coming.\u201d 456 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS The rush of the intense high blasted her with a pleasure that obliterated any con - cern she might have had about the pounding heartbeat and the feelings of agitation. For 15 minutes or so she felt incalculably witty; she loved and controlled the world. While she orbited, she didn\u2019t need sex, people, food, water, or even air. For that quarter of an hour, she felt she could live forever. Evaluation of Amanda Brandt Amanda\u2019s use of cocaine produced profound behavioral and psychological changes, including alterations in her judgment and social life (criterion B). She thought that the pleasure produced by the drug was worth the side effects it caused\u2014in her case, rapid heartbeat and a sense of agitation (C1, C7). An outside observer would probably have noticed other symptoms of acute intoxication mentioned in the criteria, but two suffice for diagnosis. Her subjective feelings give some inkling of why people become addicted to cocaine. Besides amphetamine intoxication (the symptoms are of course exactly the same), some of the other mental disorders that feature hyperactivity or mood instability should be considered. These would include bipolar disorders. Physical illnesses such as hyperthyroidism should also be considered. Phencyclidine intoxication can have per- ceptual distortions similar to cocaine intoxication. Patients who become psychotic or delirious when intoxicated must be discriminated from those with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and from delirium due to another medical condition (D). A fuller diagnosis is provided later, but from the information given in this vignette, Amanda\u2019s principal diagnosis at this point would be as given below.

F14.929 [292.89] Cocaine intoxication Stimulant Withdrawal As with intoxication, the Essential Features of amphetamine and cocaine withdrawal are identical, so I\u2019ve given them only once. Essential Features of Stimulant Withdrawal After heavy, long- lasting use of a stimulant, the patient suddenly stops or markedly reduces the intake. This yields symptoms of dysphoria plus evidence of nervous sys - tem stimulation or exhaustion: intense dreams, reduced (sometimes increased) sleep or motor activity; feelings of hunger.

Coding Notes List the specific stimulant responsible for the withdrawal when you code the patient. See Tables 15.2 and 15.3 for codes. Amphetamine Withdrawal A few hours after the last use of amphetamines, there comes the crash: agitation, anxiety, depression, and exhaustion. The user experiences an intense craving that may later wane in the face of oncoming depression, fatigue, and insomnia (which is accompanied by a paradoxical craving for sleep). Still later, voracious appetite may develop. The fatigue and apathy worsen in the half day to 4 days following the crash; acute withdrawal lasts 7\u201310 days. Suicide attempts may result. In short, the user becomes a patient. Freeman Cooke Again When he checked into detox, Freeman was still wired from the last half gram of meth he had smoked that morning. Coming off a 2-day binge, he knew from past experience that if he was going to do something about his habit, he had to take the plunge when he was still intoxicated. If he waited until he crashed, he wouldn\u2019t do anything except sleep. Then he\u2019d start looking for drugs. Freeman had declined lunch and was playing cards with three other patients at a table in the corner of the day room when he felt himself begin to slip. He noted almost with amusement that he felt like a wind-up turntable, running slower every moment. With each hand, it seemed harder to play the cards; they might have been made of",
    "patients at a table in the corner of the day room when he felt himself begin to slip. He noted almost with amusement that he felt like a wind-up turntable, running slower every moment. With each hand, it seemed harder to play the cards; they might have been made of lead. Suddenly, he was overwhelmed with depression so profound that, tired as he was, he had to try to escape. His body ached for some speed. Back in his room, he started to pack the few things he had brought in. When the gym bag was half full, he put it aside and collapsed onto the bed. He realized that he utterly lacked the energy to go out and hustle. The drug craving was gradually giving way to the need for sleep, but his eyes remained resolutely open. He was doomed to lie there for hours, paralyzed by fatigue but locked in wakefulness. It was going to be a long night. Further Evaluation of Freeman Cooke After he stopped using amphetamines (criterion A), Freeman rapidly became depressed (B). He also suffered from fatigue (B1), psychomotor slowing (B5), and insomnia (B3)\u2014 even though he badly wanted to sleep\u2014more than fulfilling the (two) symptoms 458 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS required. His typical, profound craving for speed is not a criterion for stimulant with - drawal, though it is for stimulant use disorder. The misery these symptoms caused him (C), together with the lack of any other disorder that could better explain them (D), qualify him for the diagnosis of stimulant withdrawal. The differential diagnosis of Freeman\u2019s condition would include bipolar I disor- der (because of his fluctuating moods) and other substance- induced disorders, such as cocaine withdrawal and phencyclidine intoxication. Patients who develop psychosis during intoxication may be mistakenly diagnosed as having schizophreniform disorder or other psychotic disorders. Even after most of the acute effects of withdrawal have dissipated, mood symp - toms can last for weeks or months. If that happened to Freeman, I\u2019d consider a diagno- sis of methamphetamine- induced mood disorder\u2014later. Now we\u2019d exchange Freeman\u2019s diagnosis above for the following: F15.23 [292.0] Severe methamphetamine use disorder, with amphetamine withdrawal Cocaine Withdrawal After the acute intoxication phase, blood cocaine levels drop rapidly. Unless more drug is immediately consumed, a rapid crash into depression occurs. The patient may also experience irritability, suicidal ideas, fatigue, loss of interest, and a decreased",
    "the following: F15.23 [292.0] Severe methamphetamine use disorder, with amphetamine withdrawal Cocaine Withdrawal After the acute intoxication phase, blood cocaine levels drop rapidly. Unless more drug is immediately consumed, a rapid crash into depression occurs. The patient may also experience irritability, suicidal ideas, fatigue, loss of interest, and a decreased ability to experience pleasure. Panic attacks are common; the need for cocaine is intense. Most of these symptoms tend to increase for 2\u20134 days and then abate, but depression can linger for months. Suicide attempts are fairly common; sometimes they succeed. About half of all those who have problems with cocaine use also have mood dis - orders, often bipolar or cyclothymic. This sets them quite apart from individuals with opioid- related disorders. Amanda Brandt Again In the aftermath of her intoxication, Amanda died\u2014or so it would seem, as she\u2019d feel suddenly, incurably depressed. The supreme self- confidence of moments before would be shoved aside by an anxious uncertainty that over the next day or two would gradu - ally overwhelm her. The only remedy was to smoke another lump of crack, and then another and another, until her supply ran out. Then she would be left sleepless and exhausted, while every cell in her body remembered exactly how exhilarating it felt to be high, and craved to experience it again. By her fourth year on the Exchange, Amanda\u2019s life had begun to unravel. Com - pared to the importance of using cocaine, work now seemed irrelevant. For days in a row, she would call in sick; when she did go in, her mind was focused on when and how she would score her next vial of crack. When she was finally fired, she moved to a smaller apartment and sold her BMW. Now that she could devote all of her time to Cocaine Withdrawal 459 obtaining and using crack, it took just 2 months to smoke up her life savings and the proceeds from her car. It was her final binge that brought Amanda in for treatment. After smoking her last pipeful, she roamed the hallway in her apartment building, weeping and knocking on doors. When anyone answered, she tried to push her way in. Someone called the police, who took her to the emergency room. There she became enraged and lashed out with her fists. Ultimately, she was restrained and admitted to a mental health inpatient unit. Further",
    "building, weeping and knocking on doors. When anyone answered, she tried to push her way in. Someone called the police, who took her to the emergency room. There she became enraged and lashed out with her fists. Ultimately, she was restrained and admitted to a mental health inpatient unit. Further Evaluation of Amanda Brandt Amanda\u2019s history makes it painfully clear that cocaine was the source of her disorder. When she ran out of it (criterion A), she showed (by weeping and anxiety) the requisite dysphoria and several of the physical symptoms listed in the criteria: insomnia, fatigue, and speeded-up psychomotor activity (B3, B1, B5). For any withdrawal syndrome to be diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria, it must cause marked distress or greatly affect the patient\u2019s life (C); Amanda conformed. Not included in the criteria, but typical nonethe- less, were her eidetic memory for the experience of using crack and her crushing desire for more. At this point, we have enough information to give Amanda another substance- related diagnosis: cocaine use disorder. She spent nearly all of her time (substance use disorder criterion A3) satisfying her craving (A4) for crack cocaine, which had con - sumed her car and her job (A7). Already tolerant (A10), she finally developed with - drawal symptoms (A11). A number of other cocaine- related disorders are listed in DSM-5, some of which are encountered more frequently than others. If Amanda\u2019s depression persisted sub - stantially longer than the period of withdrawal, cocaine- induced mood disorder might be added to her list. Other patients may have associated mental conditions, such as gambling disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. With a GAF score of 35 and her extensive history, I\u2019m going to rate Amanda as severely ill, and you can count symptoms\u2014if you wish.

When well developed, this disorder may resemble schizophrenia in all but the time course. Stimulant- induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations. Patients with this type of psychotic disorder may scratch excessively if they think they see bugs crawling on their skin. Stimulant intoxication delirium. Some patients experience an agitated delirium associated with intoxication. They may perform remarkable feats of strength, and their wild, irrational behavior occasionally results in someone\u2019s death. F15.99 or F14.99 [292.9] Unspecified Stimulant- Related Disorder The coding depends on whether the substance is related to amphetamines (or similar drugs, F15) or to cocaine (F14). Tobacco- related Disorders Because tens of millions of Americans are dependent on tobacco, the potential for with- drawal problems is enormous. Owing in part to the intense craving tobacco induces, it has been called the most widely used addictive drug in the United States. (And per - centage-wise, fewer Americans\u2014about one-fifth of adults\u2014smoke than is the case for citizens of most other countries.) Men and women are affected at more or less equal rates. Each year, tobacco is responsible for 5 million deaths worldwide; that\u2019s at least 60 times greater than for heroin. It is hard to find clear evidence of primary reinforcers in tobacco. That is, its chem- ical effects do not include the direct production of euphoria, elevated self- esteem, or the enhancement of energy\u2014the effects so valued by those who use, say, cocaine or opioids. Rather, tobacco produces nausea, vomiting, and anxiety, especially in the nov- ice smoker. (Although it has been reported to reduce anxiety, this is probably the effect of \u201ccuring\u201d the user\u2019s tobacco withdrawal.) So why do people smoke? In a nutshell, social factors get them started, and then they are hooked. In 2013 it was reported that people with mental illness are 70% more likely to smoke than are those without. There is a strong positive correlation between addiction to tobacco and alcoholism, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. When you are interviewing mental health patients, always ask about tobacco use. Like",
    "In 2013 it was reported that people with mental illness are 70% more likely to smoke than are those without. There is a strong positive correlation between addiction to tobacco and alcoholism, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. When you are interviewing mental health patients, always ask about tobacco use. Like caffeine, tobacco is legal, easy to obtain, and cheap (well, relative to heroin). Most people can use it without interfering in any material way with their other, non- substance- related pursuits. But in the course of a single year, they may repeatedly try Tobacco- related Disorders 461 to stop, suffer from withdrawal symptoms, and eventually return to smoking despite the knowledge that they are courting a cardiovascular catastrophe. Tobacco Use Disorder The characteristics of tobacco use disorder are similar to those of nearly every other specific substance use disorder. The criteria are those for a generic substance use disor- der (p. 396), and coding is given in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. F17.203 [292.0] Tobacco Withdrawal A patient who is withdrawing from tobacco often complains most bitterly not of the specific symptoms listed in these criteria, but of yearning for a cigarette. This persistent craving can overwhelm the ability to focus on other, more substantive (but less press - ing) issues. The result is a moody, anxious person who sleeps poorly and eats too much, knowing that everything could be fixed by one dose of a perfectly legal substance that is being used every day by over a billion people worldwide. No wonder these folks are irritable! Onset of withdrawal symptoms occurs within a day of last use, and is often detectable within a few hours. Withdrawal will occur in about half of those who stop using. I\u2019ve provided no separate case vignette for tobacco withdrawal. However, Hoyle Garner had a sleep disorder due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that was caused by smoking; his story begins on page 302. He was also diagnosed as having tobacco use disorder, and had at one time experienced tobacco withdrawal. Essential Features of Tobacco Withdrawal The patient suddenly stops or markedly reduces regular, prolonged tobacco use. Within a day, this yields multiple symptoms of dysphoria (irritability, depression, anxi- ety), restlessness, trouble concentrating, insomnia, and hunger. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration to onset of symptoms (within 24 hours) \u2022 Distress or disability (work/educational, social, or personal impairment) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (physical illness, other",

Other Tobacco- Induced Disorders The other tobacco- induced disorders are listed in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. F17.209 [292.9] Unspecified Tobacco- Related Disorder 462 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS Other (or Unknown) Substance- related Disorders The category of other (or unknown) substance- related disorders covers disorders linked to substances not included in the categories listed in Tables 15.2 and 15.3 and already described in this chapter. The generic criteria for substance use disorder (p. 396), sub- stance intoxication (p. 411), and substance withdrawal (p. 402) given earlier, or the criteria for substance- induced disorders described in other chapters (for example, substance- induced bipolar disorder), are applied here when appropriate. Here are some examples of the substances that could be included in this category: Anabolic steroids. The value to users of the anabolic steroids derives from enhanced physical attractiveness and athletic ability. For body builders and other athletes, this desire can be a powerful motivator to use these drugs. Besides the obvious effects on the physique, users report euphoria, increased libido, and at times aggression (so- called \u201c \u2019roid rage\u201d). Steroid use has been implicated in the killing of 16 civilian Afghanis by U.S. Army Sergeant Robert Bales in 2012\u2014but then, so has the antimalaria drug mefloquine. Anabolic steroids are often used in a social context, and this use may continue unabated for months or years. Similar to other substances of misuse, people take them longer than initially desired, cannot stop, spend excessive time using or try- ing to get them, and use them even though they know they cause harm. Cessation can also cause withdrawal symptoms, such as include depression, fatigue, restless- ness, insomnia, loss of appetite, and reduced interest in sex. Some users develop an intense drug craving. Nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is an anesthetic inhalant that produces lighthead - edness and mild euphoria; hence its nickname, \u201claughing gas.\u201d It is used as a propellant in cans of whipped cream and cooking sprays\u2014except when it is used to produce a high. Then it can result in a",

Then it can result in a degree of depersonalization/derealiza - tion and dizziness, with some distortion of sound. First used recreationally late in the 18th century, it may be the world\u2019s oldest artificially produced substance of abuse. Over-the- counter/prescription drugs. Over-the- counter and prescription drugs that can result in addiction include antiparkinsonian drugs, cortisone and its deriv- atives, antihistamines, and others. Betel nut. People in many cultures chew betel nut to achieve a mild high or sensa- tion of floating. Kava. Made from a pepper plant that grows in the South Pacific, kava causes seda- tion and loss of coordination and weight. Other (or Unknown) Substance- related Disorders 463 Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder Symptoms of other (or unknown) substance use disorder are identical to the generic disorder symptoms (see p. 396). Coding is given in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication The symptoms of other (or unknown) substance intoxication are identical to those in the generic substance use intoxication criteria (p. 411). Their coding is given in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal The symptoms of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal are identical to those of the generic substance use withdrawal criteria (p. 402). Their coding is given in Tables 15.2 and 15.3. recording and Coding Substance- related Disorders Use Tables 15.2 and 15.3 to code four classes of problems: substance use disorder, sub- stance intoxication, or substance withdrawal (or a combination of these), or a substance- induced mental disorder. The table for ICD-9 codes (Table 15.3) is pretty self- evident (and, as of October 2014, will no longer be necessary), so I won\u2019t elaborate further on its use. For ICD-10 codes (Table 15.2), however, read on. If your patient has substance use disorder, intoxication, or withdrawal, but no addi- tional substance- induced mental disorder, use the three columns (\u201cJust use,\u201d \u201cIntoxica- tion,\u201d and \u201cWithdrawal\u201d) under \u201cSubstance use/intoxication/withdrawal\u201d in Table 15.2 as follows: A. Determine the substance, and write down the \u201cF\u201d number. For alcohol (as an example), that would be F10. B. If substance use has been extensive enough to qualify as a substance use disor- der,",

Determine the substance, and write down the \u201cF\u201d number. For alcohol (as an example), that would be F10. B. If substance use has been extensive enough to qualify as a substance use disor- der, decide whether it is mild or moderate/severe in intensity. If there is no cur- rent intoxication or withdrawal and no associated mental disorder, read across to the \u201cJust use\u201d column, note down the decimal and trailing digits\u2014and you are done. For alcohol (indeed, for all substances), that would be either .10 or .20. C. If the patient has intoxication or withdrawal, read across to the appropriate col- umn, and write down decimal and number. (By definition, you cannot diagnose withdrawal if the patient\u2019s substance use disorder is only mild.) For alcohol, you would record F10.129 for mild use disorder with intoxication, F10.229 if use 464 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS 465 TABLE 15.2.

In some instances, intoxication or withdrawal can occur with perceptual dis - turbances. If this is the case, at step D, use the number in parentheses. In any case, you will have coded the patient for both substance use disorder and sub - stance intoxication or withdrawal. If your patient has a substance- induced mental disorder, use the 11 columns under the \u201cSubstance- induced disorders\u201d heading in Table 15.2 as follows: F. Determine the F-number for the substance. G. Determine whether there is a use disorder. If so, is it mild or moderate/severe? H.

Note that you have to specify intoxication delir- ium or withdrawal delirium, inasmuch as the codes are mostly the same. K. Beyond the numbering, there\u2019s a prescribed order for how you should lay down the words involved in a substance- related illness. Rather than a template, I\u2019ve provided some ICD-10 examples: F10.929 Alcohol intoxication F10.232 Severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal, with percep - tual disturbance F10.14 Mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol- induced bipolar disorder, with onset during intoxication recording and Coding Substance- related Disorders 469 F10.121 Mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol- induced intoxication delir- ium, acute, with mixed level of activity F10.26 Severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol- induced major neurocogni- tive disorder, persistent, amnestic\u2013 confabulatory type, with behavioral disturbance And it\u2019s conceivable that a patient could have both intoxication (or withdrawal) and a substance- induced mental disorder. Then you\u2019d end up with two sets of codes, each of which indicates the substance use disorder status. This won\u2019t happen often. F19.99 [292.9] Unspecified Other (or Unknown) Substance- Related Disorder Non- Substance- related Disorder F63.0 [312.31] Gambling Disorder Gambling is extremely common behavior that, like so much else in life, becomes a disorder only when carried to such excess that it causes problems. There are striking similarities between pathological gambling and the use of substances, not least of which is that it, like substance use, activates reward centers (ventral striatum) of the brain (dopamine is implicated). This helps explain why DSM-5 has moved gambling disorder to its current location. During an episode, most gamblers report feeling high or aroused\u2014 behavior that usually takes several years to become pathological. Initially, success leads to increased gambling; at some point, \u201cthe big win\u201d of an amount that may exceed the gambler\u2019s usual yearly earnings produces overconfidence and risk taking. From here on, because all games of chance are weighted toward the house, it is an easy (if painful) spiral into crushing loss, desperate attempts to get even, broken ties of family and friendship, and eventual ruin. In fact, attempts at suicide are a frequent complication. In the United States, gambling disorder affects about 1 adult in 200. Prevalence estimates range between 1 and 3 million individuals in",

In the United States, gambling disorder affects about 1 adult in 200. Prevalence estimates range between 1 and 3 million individuals in the United States. Males out - number females by about 2:1; women develop gambling problems later than men and seek treatment earlier. Some people only become symptomatic at certain times, such as when their sport of choice is being played. So a person who quite literally bets the farm on college football during the fall of each year may have few, if any, problems with gambling at other times of the year. Others, with broader interests, may be affected more or less chronically. Some gamblers will eventually cast off their addiction and go into remission. Clinicians need to be sensitive to the broad range of gambling activities, from convenience store scratch tickets to bingo to casual sports, slot machines, poker, dice, dogs, and the ponies. 470 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS Essential Features of Gambling Disorder Gambling so takes over the lives of these patients that they will borrow, lie, and otherwise jeopardize important relationships or opportunities. As they try to recoup their losses, they may risk more money; repeated (and futile) efforts at control yield irritability and restlessness. Some gamble as a way of coping with stress. Some bor - row or steal from others to relieve their increasingly desperate financial straits.

    "green felt, and the ball was ivory. \u201cBest quality you\u2019ll find outside of Monte Carlo,\u201d his father bragged when Randy opened it. Throughout high school, Randy loved operating a casino for his friends. Once or twice some adults drifted in from his parents\u2019 bingo night; then they played for real money. Now Randy was 25, divorced, and broke. He\u2019d had a good job managing a restau- rant near the Las Vegas strip. He couldn\u2019t honestly say he had taken his job to be near the action, but it had seemed a godsend after he\u2019d flunked out of college because of too many all-night bridge sessions (penny a point). It was an easy 5-minute walk to two of the most glittering casinos in town\u2014a walk that Randy used to take frequently on his lunch hour. \u201cI knew everybody there,\u201d he reported. \u201cI used to have accounts all over town. But nobody\u2019s let me run a tab for years.\u201d Randy\u2019s early encounters with a real roulette table had been harmless enough. At noon, he would stroll over to watch the action and place the odd bet. He won a few Gambling Disorder 471 dollars and lost a few more. All in all, he found that he could take it or leave it, mostly take it\u2014he relished the surge of adrenaline when he had money in play. He could afford modest losses; by then, he was married and his wife was making good money dealing blackjack at another casino. Then one Saturday afternoon when his wife had to work, black came up seven times in a row, and he walked away from the table with over $55,000 in his pocket. Later he said, \u201cIt was maybe the unluckiest day of my entire life.\u201d In subsequent weeks, Randy lost himself (not to mention the $55,000) in gambling fever. His lunch hour soon stretched to two as he returned to the table again and again in an effort to recoup his losses. After he was caught \u201cborrowing\u201d from his employer, he tried Gamblers Anonymous; he quit because he \u201cdidn\u2019t believe in a higher power.\u201d Over the next 2 years he became \u201ctotally obsessed,\u201d as his wife put it on more than one occasion, with the idea of scoring another big win so that he could quit ahead.

    "the next 2 years he became \u201ctotally obsessed,\u201d as his wife put it on more than one occasion, with the idea of scoring another big win so that he could quit ahead. Tired of being ignored and lied to about their finances, she finally left him. \u201cShe said she might as well be married to a one-armed bandit,\u201d Randy sadly remarked. Attentive and pleasant, Randy sat quietly throughout his interview. Though he expressed remorse for the difficulties he had caused himself and others, he described his mood as neither depressed nor ecstatic, but \u201cin the middle.\u201d His speech was clear and goal- directed. His cognition and reasoning were excellent. Before his wife left, Randy had pleaded with her to stay. He promised to reform. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on it,\u201d she\u2019d told him. Evaluation of Randy Porter Like many other nascent gamblers, Randy got his start as an adolescent through gam - bling activities in his home. In the course of a few years, he became thoroughly preoc- cupied with gambling (criterion A4); unsuccessfully tried to control it (A3); chased his losses with more betting (A6); and lied, stole, and eventually lost his wife and his job (A7, A9, A8). He would therefore amply meet the symptomatic criteria (only four are required) for gambling disorder, provided that his behavior was not better accounted for by a manic episode (B). However, Randy showed no symptoms of mania, no depression, and no evidence of periodicity in his gambling behavior\u2014so we can safely rule that out. Social gamblers set limits on their losses and gamble in the company of friends; profes- sional gamblers respect the odds and maintain strict self- discipline. Randy\u2019s behavior fit neither pattern. The real challenge in evaluating any patient who gambles excessively is to deter - mine whether there is an associated mental disorder. Commonly associated conditions include mood disorders, panic disorder, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and agora- phobia. Also look for problems with substance use (which can precede or accompany gambling behavior) and suicide attempts (which may result from it). When present, any comorbid mental disorder is likely to have begun first. Of course, people with antisocial personality disorder can become heavily involved in gambling, and research has also identified borderline personality disorder 472 SUBSTANCE-rELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISO rDErS in such a population. However, Randy showed none of the behaviors that would be diagnostic of those personality disorders. Neither had he",

However, Randy showed none of the behaviors that would be diagnostic of those personality disorders. Neither had he demonstrated any evidence that his behavior was episodic, and he certainly wasn\u2019t in remission (the other possible specifier, other than severity), so his full diagnosis would be\u2014 Uh, wait a minute. Let\u2019s talk about severity. According to the DSM-5 criteria, Randy barely qualifies for a severity level of moderate. But here\u2019s a fellow whose addic- tion (I\u2019m not afraid to call it that) had essentially ruined his life. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s working now, but I doubt that it\u2019s for his original employer, and he\u2019s probably sleeping in his car. I\u2019d give him a relatively low GAF score of 55, and I don\u2019t call any of this a moderate anything. Once again, I\u2019m going to assert clinician\u2019s prerogative and say that his level of severity would be\u2014severe. F63.0 [312.31] Gambling disorder, severe, persistent Z63.5 [V61.03] Divorced Gambling Disorder 473 474 CHAPTEr 16 Cognitive Disorders Here\u2019s why I\u2019m departing from the DSM-5 name for this chapter: When I was re- reading this chapter prior to publication, I noticed that I was growing confused. The new name for dementia is major neurocognitive disorder, whereas the new name for the collected cognitive disorders is neurocognitive disorders. In some passages, I wasn\u2019t sure myself exactly what I had meant\u2014one disorder or the whole collection! If it gave me trouble, surely it would other readers, too. So, after much thought and consulta - tion, I decided to stick with the DSM-IV title for the chapter, and reserve neuro cognitive disorder (ncD) for the conditions we used to call dementia. Quick Guide to the Cognitive Disorders With a structure simplified in DSM-5, classification of the cognitive disorders is logical, though the details can be pretty darned complex. Delirium A delirium is a rapidly developing, fluctuating state of reduced awareness in which the fol- lowing are true: \u2022\u2022 The patient has trouble with awareness (operationally defined as orientation) and shifting or focusing of attention, and \u2022\u2022 The patient has at least one defect of memory, orientation, perception, visuospatial skills, or language, and \u2022\u2022 The symptoms are not better explained by coma or another cognitive disorder.

    "true: \u2022\u2022 The patient has trouble with awareness (operationally defined as orientation) and shifting or focusing of attention, and \u2022\u2022 The patient has at least one defect of memory, orientation, perception, visuospatial skills, or language, and \u2022\u2022 The symptoms are not better explained by coma or another cognitive disorder. One of the following causes can be identified (here and throughout, the page number in each case indicates where a more detailed discussion begins): Delirium due to another medical condition. Delirium can be caused by trauma to the brain, infections, epilepsy, endocrine disorders, toxicity from medications, poisons, and various other diseases affecting almost any part of the body (p. 480). I have listed many of these conditions in the \u201cPhysical Disorders That Affect Mental Diagnosis\u201d table in the Appendix. Occasionally more than one cause for delirium will be identified in the same patient. Substance intoxication delirium, substance withdrawal delirium, and medication- induced delirium. Alcohol and other sedative drugs of abuse, as well as nearly every class of street drug, can cause delirium in both intoxication and withdrawal. Medications can also be impli- cated (p. 483). Delirium due to multiple etiologies. Delirium can have multiple causes in the same patient (p. 486). Other specified, and unspecified, delirium. Use one of these categories when you don\u2019t know the cause of a patient\u2019s delirium or when it doesn\u2019t fully meet diagnostic criteria (p. 487). Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders A major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) differs from delirium in several ways: \u2022\u2022 The time course is relatively slow. Delirium develops across hours or days, an NCD across weeks and months. \u2022\u2022 Although patients with NCDs can have impaired ability to focus or shift attention, it isn\u2019t prominent. \u2022\u2022 The cause of an NCD can usually be found within the central nervous system; the cause of delirium is often elsewhere in the body. \u2022\u2022 Some patients recover from an NCD, but this isn\u2019t the usual course. DSM-5 now distinguishes between major NCD (which was called dementia in previous DSMs) and mild NCD. In mild NCD, any of the etiologies listed below can be implicated in rela - tively mild effects on a person\u2019s ability to function independently. Discerning the boundaries between major and mild NCD can be problematic, however. One of the following types of NCD will be identified: Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

    "in rela - tively mild effects on a person\u2019s ability to function independently. Discerning the boundaries between major and mild NCD can be problematic, however. One of the following types of NCD will be identified: Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is the most common cause of NCD. It begins gradually and usually progresses inexorably. A bit more than half of all major NCDs are of the Alzheimer\u2019s type (p. 498). Major or mild vascular NCD. Due to vascular brain disease, these patients experience loss of memory and other cognitive abilities. Often this is a stepwise process, with relatively sudden onset and a fluctuating course. Some 10\u201320% of major NCDs are vascular (p. 516). Major or mild NCD due to other medical conditions, A large number of medical conditions Quick Guide to the Cognitive Disorders 475 can cause NCDs (again, see \u201cPhysical Disorders . . . \u201d in the Appendix). Some of the most noteworthy (pp. 504ff) include brain tumor, Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (infection by a slow virus, or prion disease), traumatic brain injury, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and frontotemporal NCD (formerly Pick\u2019s disease). The most common toxins causing NCDs are those resulting from kidney and liver failure. Substance/medication- induced major or mild NCD. Some 5\u201310% of NCDs are related to pro- longed use of alcohol, inhalants, or sedatives (p. 522). Major or mild NCD due to multiple etiologies. Like a delirium, an NCD can have multiple causes in the same patient (p. 526). Unspecified NCD. This category is useful when you know the patient\u2019s cognitive status is impaired, but you don\u2019t know why (p. 527). Other Causes of Cognitive Symptoms Dissociative disorders. Profound, temporary loss of memory may occur in persons who suf- fer from dissociative amnesia (p. 239) or dissociative identity disorder (p. 245). Pseudodementia. From their apathy and slowed responses, some patients often look as if they have the severe memory loss and other symptoms of major NCD (dementia). But careful clinical evaluation and psychological testing reveal severe major depressive disorder (p. 122) and cognitive functioning that is relatively intact, though they may have problems with attention and concentration. Pseudodementia accounts for about 5% of elderly patients referred for a dementia workup. Pseudodementia is a useful term DSM-5 doesn\u2019t use. Malingering. Some patients will intentionally exaggerate or falsify cognitive symptoms to obtain funds (insurance, workers\u2019 compensation) or to avoid punishment",
    "though they may have problems with attention and concentration. Pseudodementia accounts for about 5% of elderly patients referred for a dementia workup. Pseudodementia is a useful term DSM-5 doesn\u2019t use. Malingering. Some patients will intentionally exaggerate or falsify cognitive symptoms to obtain funds (insurance, workers\u2019 compensation) or to avoid punishment or military service (p. 599). Factitious disorder imposed on self. Some patients may feign cognitive symptoms, but not for direct gain (such as gaining money or avoiding punishment). Their motive often appears to be hospitalized or otherwise cared for (p. 268). Whatever happened to age- related cognitive decline? This DSM-IV diagnosis referred to the fact that older patients often report trouble remembering names, telephone numbers, or places where they put things. On testing, they tend to look pretty normal. However, DSM-5 just considers it a part of what\u2019s normal, deserving of no special coding. It takes objective evidence of impairment in at least one cognitive domain to cause DSM-5 to sit up and take notice. 476 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Introduction Cognition refers to the mental processing of information\u2014more specifically, memory and thinking in the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information to achieve knowledge. A clinician obtains information about these processes by observation dur - ing an interview and by asking the patient to perform certain tasks during the mental status evaluation. The cognitive disorders (major, mild, and delirium) are abnormalities of these mental processes that are associated with temporary or permanent brain dysfunction. Their main symptoms include problems with memory, orientation, language, informa- tion processing, and the ability to focus and sustain attention on a task. A cognitive disorder is caused by a medical condition or substance use that leads to defects of brain structure, chemistry, or physiology. However, the underlying causative agent cannot always be defined. With early recognition and adequate treatment, many cognitive disorders (espe - cially deliriums) are reversible; ignored, they will sometimes spontaneously improve, but often they cause permanent disability. Moreover, though the criteria are relatively simple, their associated symptoms can cause cognitive disorders to mimic virtually any other mental condition. For example, delirium can present with symptoms of depres - sion and anxiety; major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) can present with psychosis. Whatever your patient\u2019s history or symptoms, it is therefore vital to consider neurocog- nitive etiologies near the top of your differential diagnosis. If you forget about cognitive disorders, emotional symptoms can all too easily",
    "with symptoms of depres - sion and anxiety; major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) can present with psychosis. Whatever your patient\u2019s history or symptoms, it is therefore vital to consider neurocog- nitive etiologies near the top of your differential diagnosis. If you forget about cognitive disorders, emotional symptoms can all too easily obscure an underlying delirium, or you might diagnose a psychotic disorder when your patient actually has a dementia. Depending on the underlying cause, cognitive disorders can begin at any age. They are extremely common, especially in a hospital setting. They may constitute up to one in five of all mental health admissions. Delirium Although the brain itself can be involved directly (as with a brain tumor or seizure dis- order), most deliriums are caused by disease processes that begin outside the central nervous system. These include endocrine disorders, infections, drug toxicity or with - drawal, vitamin deficiency, fever, liver and kidney disease, poisons, and the effects of surgical operations. (A more complete listing is given in the \u201cPhysical Disorders . . . \u201d table in the Appendix.) We can easily state the basic symptoms of delirium: \u2022\u2022 In just hours to several days, the patient develops . . . \u2022\u2022 Reduction in awareness and attention , accompanied by . . . Delirium 477 \u2022\u2022 Some sort of additional cognitive deficit, such as problems with orientation, memory, language, perception, or visuospatial capability. \u2022\u2022 The intensity of these symptoms tends to fluctuate during the course of a day. Inattention is often the first symptom you might notice. During an interview, you identify difficulty focusing on the topic at hand; the patient may experience it as drows- iness or somnolence. Thought processes slow down and appear vague; you may detect trouble with reasoning and solving problems. You may have to ask questions several times before the patient responds. On the other hand, inattention may show up instead as a hyperalert distractibility, with rapid shifting from one focus to another. Any of several areas can constitute the additional cognitive deficit; two or more may occur at the same time. Language. You will recognize problems with language in speech that is rambling, disjointed, pressured, or incoherent, or speech that leaps from one topic to another. Some patients will have trouble writing or naming things. Speech that is merely slurred, without demonstrating incoherent thoughts, suggests intoxication, not delirium. Memory. Delirious patients nearly always have trouble remembering",
    "with language in speech that is rambling, disjointed, pressured, or incoherent, or speech that leaps from one topic to another. Some patients will have trouble writing or naming things. Speech that is merely slurred, without demonstrating incoherent thoughts, suggests intoxication, not delirium. Memory. Delirious patients nearly always have trouble remembering things. Recent events are always affected first; older memories (especially those from childhood) are usually the last to go. Executive functioning. The person has difficulty in planning, organizing, sequenc- ing, or abstracting information. In practice, the person has trouble making deci - sions, taking steps that break a habit pattern, correcting errors, or searching for the source of a problem (troubleshooting). Obviously, novel or complicated situations will be fraught for these people. Orientation. Many patients will be disoriented, sometimes so severely that you cannot examine them adequately. Disorientation is most likely to be for time (date, day, month, year); next comes disorientation for place; last, patients fail to recog - nize relatives and friends (disorientation for person). Only the most severely ill patients are unsure of their own identities. Perception. Patients with even mild or early delirium don\u2019t perceive their sur - roundings as clearly as usual: Boundaries are fuzzy, colors are abnormally bright, images distorted. Some patients misidentify what they see (illusions), whereas oth- ers experience false perceptions (hallucinations are especially likely to be visual). If they later experience false beliefs or ideas (delusions) grafted onto their hallu - cinations, these delusions are usually incomplete, changing, or poorly organized. Confronted by visual misperceptions, patients may not be able to tell whether they are dreaming or awake. Those who accept their hallucinations as reality may feel quite anxious or fearful. 478 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Other areas often revealing disturbance in delirium include the following: Sleep\u2013wake cycle. A change in a patient\u2019s normal sleep cycle (insomnia, day\u2013night reversal, vivid dreams, nightmares) almost invariably occurs. Psychomotor activity and behavior. Sometimes physical movements may be slowed, especially if the delirium is due to metabolic problems; these patients appear retarded and sluggish. Others may experience increased motor activity (agitated behavior, picking at bedclothes). A flapping tremor of the hands is com - mon. So are vocalizations, which are sometimes no more than muttering or moans, though some patients may weep or call out. Those who feel threatened may strike out or attempt to escape. Mood. Depression and fear are common emotional reactions to the",
    "flapping tremor of the hands is com - mon. So are vocalizations, which are sometimes no more than muttering or moans, though some patients may weep or call out. Those who feel threatened may strike out or attempt to escape. Mood. Depression and fear are common emotional reactions to the experiences mentioned above; mood often becomes unstable, perceived by others as lability of affect. (Dysphoria can sometimes be the presenting symptom in delirium; then there is a danger of misdiagnosing the patient as having a major depressive disor - der.) Some patients will only react with perplexity; still others will exhibit bland, calm acceptance, or perhaps even intense anger or euphoria. Delirium usually begins suddenly, and its intensity often fluctuates. Most patients will be more lucid in the morning and worse at night\u2014a transient phenomenon called sundowning. When you suspect delirium, try to interview the patient in sessions sev - eral hours apart. Because the symptoms of delirium so often fluctuate with time of day, normal or marginal findings at noon may give way to clear evidence of illness in the evening. If multiple visits are not practical, nursing staff (or chart notes) may provide the needed information. Though symptoms may persist for days to weeks, most deliriums last a week or less and then resolve, once the underlying condition has been relieved. Some, how - ever, will evolve into dementia. After delirium resolves, most patients recall the experi- ences incompletely; they may have amnesia for certain (or all) aspects, and that which is recalled may seem like a dream. Delirium is common on medical wards, where it may be mistaken for other mental disorders, including psychosis, depression, mania, \u201chysteria,\u201d or personality disorder. Delirium has the overall highest incidence of all mental disorders. By some esti - mates, up to half of hospitalized elderly patients become delirious. It is more common in children and the elderly than in young and middle-aged adults. Delirium has many aliases. neurologists and internists call it acute confusional state. Other terms sometimes used for delirium include toxic psychosis, acute brain syndrome , and metabolic encephalopathy. These terms are useful to know when you are discussing a delirious patient with clinicians who do not specialize in mental health. Some clinicians regard delirium as a state of agitated mental confusion during which Delirium 479 the patient experiences visual hallucinations that are unusually vivid. This would be the",
    "These terms are useful to know when you are discussing a delirious patient with clinicians who do not specialize in mental health. Some clinicians regard delirium as a state of agitated mental confusion during which Delirium 479 the patient experiences visual hallucinations that are unusually vivid. This would be the case for delirium tremens. However, DSM-5 uses the term delirium in a much broader sense, to encompass conditions with the more varied symptoms mentioned in the Essen - tial Features. Essential Features of Delirium Over a short time, the patient develops problems with attention that wanders and with orientation (especially to the environment); additional cognitive changes (mem- ory, use of language, disorientation in other spheres, perception, visuomotor capa - bility) set in. Severity fluctuates during the day. The cause can be pinned on a physi- cal condition, substance use, toxicity, or some combination.

ICD-10 prescribes the order as to how you lay down the words when a delirium has been caused by substance use; see the footnotes to Table 15.2. F05 [293.0] Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition Delirium can have many causes, related in part to the patient\u2019s age group. In children, fever and infection are the most common causes; in young adults, drugs; in middle-aged adults, withdrawal from alcohol and head injury; in the elderly, metabolic issues, car - 480 C OGNITIVE DISORDERS diovascular failure, and excessive medications. Often delirium in an older patient will have multiple causes (see p. 486). Because it may be caused by a disease that can lead to dementia or even kill out - right, any delirium is a true emergency.

Again, the \u201cPhysical Disorders . . . \u201d table in the Appendix lists some of the more frequently encountered medical causes of delirium. Harold Hoyt After rheumatic heart disease had led to years of gradually worsening fatigue and short- ness of breath, Harold Hoyt, a 48-year-old bricklayer, finally consented to a mitral valve replacement. Warning him that open heart surgery could cause delirium, his surgeon had recommended mental health consultation as a preventive measure. \u201cI ain\u2019t crazy,\u201d Harold replied by way of refusal. The procedure went well, but the recovery room staff noticed right away that Harold seemed withdrawn and uncommunicative. He ignored his wife and daughter during their brief hourly visits. When he spoke or wrote notes, it was usually to complain about the tube in his nose or about his inability to sleep in the brightly lighted intensive care unit. On the third postoperative day, Harold became increasingly restless. After he pulled out his nasogastric tube, he was quieter for a time, but in the evening he was found crying and trying to get out of bed. He asked a nurse why he was there, and was incredulous when told that he had had open heart surgery. As they spoke, his voice trailed off, and he seemed to forget that anyone was there. When he spoke again, he asked about a football game that had been played the week before. The following morning Harold carried on a routine, though brief, conversation with the dietary aide who brought breakfast. But by nightfall he was again talking to himself and had to be restrained from pulling out his IV. He was able to give the date accurately, however. A mental health consultant diagnosed a \u201cclassic postcardiotomy delirium\u201d and recommended that family members sit with Harold to provide stimulation and reality checks. Within 36 hours he was fully oriented and conversing normally with his family, and his improved physical condition allowed him to be moved to a bed on the ward. He remembered nothing of his behavior of the previous 2",
    "family members sit with Harold to provide stimulation and reality checks. Within 36 hours he was fully oriented and conversing normally with his family, and his improved physical condition allowed him to be moved to a bed on the ward. He remembered nothing of his behavior of the previous 2 days and seemed surprised that he had required restraints. Evaluation of Harold Hoyt In the hours after surgery, Harold\u2019s problem with attention caused him to have dif - ficulty even expressing a thought (his voice trailed off in midsentence, and he veered Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition 481 off into a discussion of football); the fact that he was also unaware of his surround - ings completes the requirement for delirium criterion A. His cognitive problems had developed rapidly and fluctuated with time of day, increasing in the evening and at night (sundowning\u2014 criterion B). He had further problems with short-term memory (among other things, he forgot that he had had surgery), and on at least one occasion he was disoriented to time (either of these issues would pass muster for criterion C). He wasn\u2019t comatose, and he\u2019d had no preexisting neurocognitive disorder that would bet- ter explain his symptoms (D). His recent history of heart surgery provides evidence of a direct link to his delirium; indeed, his surgeon had warned him it might happen (E). We need to consider a differential diagnosis, even though the criteria do not describe one beyond a cognitive disorder. When his delirium was first developing, Har- old was withdrawn and seemed irritable. These features suggest a depressive disorder, which is only one of many mental disorders sometimes confused with the cognitive disorders. Because hallucinations are so common, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders also appear in the differential diagnosis, though the history of an operation and rapid fluctuations in cognition are pretty reliable (but hardly infallible) giveaways. Occasionally a patient (especially one who has a background in health care) will feign the symptoms of delirium to obtain money or some other material benefit. This sort of deception can be difficult to detect; when it is found, malingering is the usual desig - nation (though I tend to be really parsimonious with this Z-code). When the motive behind such deception is only to be a patient, consider factitious disorder imposed on self. Harold became somewhat agitated and tried to get out of bed; perhaps this",
    "is found, malingering is the usual desig - nation (though I tend to be really parsimonious with this Z-code). When the motive behind such deception is only to be a patient, consider factitious disorder imposed on self. Harold became somewhat agitated and tried to get out of bed; perhaps this was due to anxiety at finding himself in a strange place without knowing why. But there are plenty of people who have anxiety symptoms without having an anxiety disorder. The variety of potential causes of delirium is vast; although many of them are included in the \u201cPhysical Disorders . . . \u201d table in the Appendix, the list there is by no means comprehensive. As Harold\u2019s consultant noted, cardiotomy is a classical precipi- tant of delirium (experienced by about 25% of patients after open heart surgery). Some- what ironically for Harold, the strongest preventative measure against postcardiotomy delirium is a mental health consultation before surgery. When you are coding a delirium, be sure to include the medical condition(s) responsible. Harold\u2019s GAF score at consultation was a low 40; by discharge, it had improved to a relatively robust 71. Z95.2 [V43.3] Prosthetic heart valve F05 [293.0] Delirium due to chest surgery, acute, hyperactive \u201cDelirium Due to Medical c ause Often Misdiagnosed.\u201d That headline in an online report described a paper recently presented at a geriatric psychiatry meeting. Of 112 consecu - tive patients admitted with the diagnosis of a mental health disorder, 27\u2014nearly one- quarter\u2014were ultimately found to be suffering from a delirium due to some underlying medical disorder. The most frequent diagnosis was a urinary tract infection. Other condi - 482 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS tions affecting more than a single patient included drug usage and poor control of blood sugar. Mostly, the patients were at first diagnosed as having a different cognitive disorder, but psychoses and mood disorders were also prevalent. Substance Intoxication Delirium, Substance Withdrawal Delirium, and Medication- Induced Delirium People who abuse street drugs or alcohol are at serious risk for developing a delirium. Many drugs can produce intoxication delirium, but abrupt cessation of heavy use of other sedative drugs, such as alcohol and barbiturates, are notorious for causing with - drawal delirium. The most commonly known is alcohol withdrawal delirium (popularly called delirium tremens, or DTs). Its hallmarks are agitation, tremor, disorientation, and vivid hallucinations.

    "sedative drugs, such as alcohol and barbiturates, are notorious for causing with - drawal delirium. The most commonly known is alcohol withdrawal delirium (popularly called delirium tremens, or DTs). Its hallmarks are agitation, tremor, disorientation, and vivid hallucinations. In someone who has suddenly stopped after many weeks of heavy drinking, DTs can occur within a few days. DTs can also be precipitated when a substance- misusing patient develops a medical illness (such as liver failure, head trauma, pneumonia, or pancreatitis); alcohol users are at special risk for each of these conditions. Alcohol withdrawal delirium isn\u2019t especially common, even among the heaviest users of alcohol. But it is so severe that if it goes untreated, up to 15% die. This makes it an extremely important mental health event. Delirium\u2014 especially intoxication delirium, but also the withdrawal type\u2014can also be caused by prescribed medications, which don\u2019t necessarily have to be present in high concentrations. In combination with other drugs or illnesses, low doses can cause delirium, especially in older people. Drugs with anticholinergic effects (such as antiparkinsonian agents and antidepressants) are probably the most likely to produce delirium. Although intoxication delirium can occur within minutes of taking cocaine or hallucinogens, for many other substances it will occur only after drug levels have built up over several days or longer. Rodney Partridge A barroom knife fight had left Rodney Partridge with a severed artery in his arm that required 2 hours in the operating room and several units of whole blood. But apart from a slight tremor, when Rodney awakened from the anesthesia late Sunday morning, he felt almost as good as new. By evening he was eating voraciously and enjoying the attentions of the nursing staff. On Monday, however, when the surgeon came around to make sure the dressing was still dry, the head nurse confided in a worried whisper: \u201cHe\u2019s been awake most of the night, demanding to be released. The last hour or two, he\u2019s been trying to pick things off his sheets.\u201d When the mental health consultant appeared in his doorway, Rodney was propped up in bed; he was restrained by a canvas halter around his chest and by leather cuffs around his ankles and left wrist. His free hand trembled and roamed the bedclothes, pausing occasionally to pinch up a bit of air and fling it to the floor. Then Rodney threw a triangle of toast at the",
    "restrained by a canvas halter around his chest and by leather cuffs around his ankles and left wrist. His free hand trembled and roamed the bedclothes, pausing occasionally to pinch up a bit of air and fling it to the floor. Then Rodney threw a triangle of toast at the curtain rod over his window. Substance- related Delirium 483 \u201cGot him! Cheeky bugger.\u201d \u201cGot who?\u201d the consultant wanted to know. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d Startled, Rodney lurched against his chest restraints and dropped a second piece of toast onto the sheet. Leaving the toast where it lay, he returned to plucking at his bedclothes. \u201cGot who?\u201d repeated the consultant. Rodney\u2019s gaze returned to the curtain rod. \u201cIt was those guys up there. One of them mooned me.\u201d The guys were about 4 inches tall and wore short pants, green jackets, and pointed caps. For half an hour they had been parading around on top of the curtain rod, making obscene gestures and throwing multicolored caterpillars onto Rodney\u2019s bed. Whenever a caterpillar landed, it would begin crawling toward him, munching a swath across the sheet as it came. Although he wasn\u2019t exactly frightened, Rodney was far from placid. With his gaze constantly darting around the room, he seemed to be watching for other predators. He insisted that the guys and caterpillars were real, but he had no idea why they were there. He was also vague about his orientation. He knew he was in a hospital whose name he had \u201cnever been told,\u201d thought he had been admitted a week earlier, and missed the date by nearly 5 months. When Rodney was asked to subtract sevens from 100, he responded: \u201cAh, 93 . . . 80 . . . um . . . there\u2019s a purple one.\u201d With a little urging and a lot of Librium for sedation, Rodney admitted that he had been a heavy drinker most of his adult life. Too many vodka sours had landed him currently between jobs (and wives), and for the last 3 months he had spent most of his waking hours consuming a quart or more of hard liquor per day. Although his morn - ing shakes often required \u201ca hair of the dog,\u201d he had never before had hallucinations. He agreed that he was \u201cprobably an alcoholic\u201d\u2014in fact, he\u2019d started with Alcoholics Anonymous several times, but had never been able to stay the course.",

He agreed that he was \u201cprobably an alcoholic\u201d\u2014in fact, he\u2019d started with Alcoholics Anonymous several times, but had never been able to stay the course. Evaluation of Rodney Partridge Several points in Rodney\u2019s history suggest some sort of cognitive disorder. First, his ori- entation was poor (he was unclear about the date and had no idea what hospital he was in). The second tipoff to delirium was his reduced attention span (he had difficulty focus- ing on his conversation with the mental health consultant). Together, these two features constitute criterion A for a delirium. The symptoms had begun rapidly and appeared to be a change for Rodney (B); it is only with time that we would know the extent to which they would fluctuate, and Rodney\u2019s consultant intervened with treatment first. Rodney also had rather dramatic hallucinations (perceptual changes, one of the several alternative additional disturbances required by criterion C). The hallucinations of alcohol withdrawal and other withdrawal deliriums are classically visual, but they can be auditory or tactile. If delusions occur, their content is often related to the hal - lucinations. Rodney had several other symptoms typically associated with delirium. He had 484 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS become so hyperactive (increased startle response, trying to get out of bed) and agi - tated that he had to be restrained. His tremor was evident. Although Rodney was only bemused, many patients are badly frightened by hallucinations, which can be grotesque beyond belief. His symptoms were clearly more severe than you\u2019d encounter in simple alcohol withdrawal; by themselves they would warrant clinical attention. Hallucinations could suggest schizophrenia, a mistake careful clinicians avoid by asking informants how long the patient has had psychotic symptoms. (See the sidebar below for some points that discriminate causes of psychosis.) As with any delirium, other conditions to rule out include other psychotic disorders, malingering, and facti- tious disorder. In Rodney\u2019s case, history provided ample evidence for a causal relation- ship between his drinking and his symptoms (E). Although Rodney Partridge would meet the criteria for alcohol withdrawal (p. 406), this diagnosis is superseded by alcohol withdrawal delirium. We need to choose between the specifiers for acuteness and activity level. And here\u2019s another point: Because they occurred only during a delirium, we don\u2019t",
    "drinking and his symptoms (E). Although Rodney Partridge would meet the criteria for alcohol withdrawal (p. 406), this diagnosis is superseded by alcohol withdrawal delirium. We need to choose between the specifiers for acuteness and activity level. And here\u2019s another point: Because they occurred only during a delirium, we don\u2019t make a separate diagnosis for his psychosis. That\u2019s a general point that has applicability for problems with mood, anxi- ety, sleep, and sex, any of which can become problematic during a delirium. Of course, Rodney would also qualify for a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (see p. 397): In addition to the symptoms of withdrawal, he had tried Alcoholics Anonymous without success, and he preferred drinking to working. Although the number of sub - stance use symptoms mentioned here isn\u2019t high by actual count, I\u2019d still code as severe just about any patient who has had DTs. In any event, the presence of alcohol use disor- der helps determine his two mental health diagnoses. In coding Rodney\u2019s disorders, I have referred to Tables 15.2 and 15.3 in Chapter 15. His GAF score on admission would be a strikingly low 30.

Of course, it\u2019s important to know when that is the case, because treatment of the delirium can greatly ameliorate the discomfort (to all) of the hallucinations and, sometimes, delusions. but studies show that delirium is often underdi- agnosed in patients with dementia, and that the two disorders often occur together. Here are a few differences: Delusions. In dementia, they are typically of being robbed or abandoned. In delirium, they more likely to concern dangers in the immediate environment. Hallucinations. In delirium, visual hallucinations and illusions are common. In Substance- related Delirium 485 Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, they are not so common (but they are more common in Lewy body dementia). Flow of thought. Delirious people are likely to have thought processes that are illogi- cal, perhaps with derailment. In dementia, poverty of thought is more likely. Attention.

It\u2019s affected in delirium, though relatively spared in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia (however, it is deeply affected in Lewy body dementia). F05 [293.0] Delirium Due to Multiple Etiologies Probably more patients than are ever recognized have multiple causes for delirium. Many such diagnoses are undoubtedly missed because the clinician is aware of one cause and fails to identify the others. The signs and symptoms do not differ from those in the foregoing examples, but of course, successful treatment can hinge heavily upon accurate identification of all contributing factors. Delirium due to multiple etiologies is not really a single diagnosis\u2014it is a col - lection of two or more diagnoses occurring in a single patient. I include it here as a reminder of its importance: Treatment is hard when you don\u2019t know all of the causes. It is especially common among older people, who are likely to have numerous medical problems. Emil Brion At age 72, Emil Brion already had such severe emphysema that he required oxygen day and night. \u201cI always warned him about smoking, but he was actually proud of being a three-pack-a-day man,\u201d said his wife. \u201cNow, if he takes the oxygen off to smoke, he gets goofy and scared.\u201d She meant that Emil would see things: A light cord would become a snake; a pile of clothes on the chair looked for an instant like a lion ready to spring. He might wake up whimpering from a nightmare. Sometimes he seemed so distracted that she could hardly persuade him to put the oxygen back on. But all things considered, he was doing pretty well. He could even drive a little, as long as he used his oxygen. That lasted until the Fourth of July, when Emil strolled barefoot into the back yard and sliced the outer sole of his heel on a broken piece of glass. The cut didn\u2019t hurt much, so he forgot to clean it up when he went back inside. It was several days before either he or his wife noticed how red and swollen the injured area had become. By that time, according to the specialist in infectious diseases who admitted him to the hospital, he had developed a severe septicemia. Despite continuous IV antibiotics, for 3 days Emil\u2019s temperature hovered above 102 degrees. Even with nasal",
    "his wife noticed how red and swollen the injured area had become. By that time, according to the specialist in infectious diseases who admitted him to the hospital, he had developed a severe septicemia. Despite continuous IV antibiotics, for 3 days Emil\u2019s temperature hovered above 102 degrees. Even with nasal oxygen running, his arterial oxygen saturation was low. During much of the day he slept; at night he was awake, mumbling to himself and groaning. When he spoke clearly enough to be understood, he complained that he was a miserable old man and wished he were dead. 486 C OGNITIVE DISORDERS On Emil\u2019s seventh hospital day, his fever finally broke. He removed the oxygen tube and told the nurse, \u201cWheel me outside so I can have a smoke.\u201d Evaluation of Emil Brion Emil\u2019s wife noted that when he went without his oxygen, he was sometimes so dis - tracted that he couldn\u2019t even focus on restarting his oxygen. When a second disorder (systemic infection) was added to the anoxia, he rapidly (delirium criterion B) became somnolent (A). His other cognitive difficulties (C) included illusions (the light-cord snake) and nightmares, and he began to mumble (language difficulties). Several other symptoms typically associated with delirium were also apparent. He had a change in his sleep pattern (drowsy during the day, awake at night). He became depressed and even wished himself dead; perhaps at times he recognized how desper- ately ill he was. As to preexisting cognitive conditions (D), the only one would be the possibility of another delirium. Even before the infection set in, Emil had fluctuating states of consciousness and attention with occasional hallucinations, suggesting a persistent delirium caused by anoxia. But his mental condition had more than one cause, as shown by the fact that the infection made him sicker, even when nasal oxygen was running. That either could cause delirium satisfies criterion E. Once the infection in his bloodstream was resolved and his fever broke, his cognition suddenly improved. However, a complete evaluation of his mental status would be needed to be sure there were no residual symptoms of dementia or a depressive disorder. We wouldn\u2019t confuse his perceptual problems with schizophrenia because they developed so rapidly. Note that in the coding of Emil\u2019s delirium, a separate code for each specific cause is indicated by a separate line, though in his case the numbers remain the same. His GAF",

For other specified delirium, DSM-5 specifically mentions the following: Attenuated delirium syndrome. The symptoms of delirium are not severe enough for a more specific diagnosis. Unspecified Delirium 487 Symptom Domains Although we can organize our thinking about them in different ways, over the years some consensus has developed of what constitutes the domains important for the study of what DSM-5 now calls major and mild neurocognitive disorders (NCDs). Here are descriptions of those that DSM-5 considers central to the understanding of all cognitive disorders, but especially to major NCD (dementia). Those who write (and do research) about cognitive matters often refer to neurocognitive domains. However, they never quite define just what they mean by domain. DSM-5 has carried that tradition forward, even to the extent of ignoring it in its own glossary; I will now attempt to break it. The Oxford English Dictionary says that a domain is \u201ca sphere of thought or action,\u201d a dimension of thought or a field of knowledge. Therefore, we can regard a neurocognitive domain as a group of functions that pertains to one aspect of thinking, perception, or memory. and, wouldn\u2019t you know, even domains can have domains (well, sometimes DSM-5 calls them facets). For example, the domain of language includes naming, grammar, recep- tive language, fluency, and word finding. a nd just where DSM-5\u2019s facets belong is also a bit fraught. Depending on the expert you consult, you can find working memory located as an aspect of memory and learning, a component of complex attention, or a subdivision of executive functioning. Good luck.

    "you can find working memory located as an aspect of memory and learning, a component of complex attention, or a subdivision of executive functioning. Good luck. Complex Attention Complex attention means the ability to focus on tasks in such a way that their comple - tion isn\u2019t derailed by distractions. It is more than the simple attention span you evalu - ate when you ask a patient to repeat a string of digits or spell world backwards. It also involves processing speed, holding information in mind, and being able to attend (more or less) to more than one thing at once, like writing a grocery list while listening to the radio. In mild NCD, a patient may be able to perform tasks when a lot is going on, but it will take extra effort. Pauline has begun to have trouble using her computer. If a phone call interrupts her, she may spend minutes trying to determine where she left off. She used to read the newspaper and write email online; now she must limit herself, so as not to become confused. Jason\u2019s daughter-in-law complained (for him) that in the past several months, he\u2019d had increasing difficulty dressing himself. \u201cIf I\u2019m talking to him, he gets distracted and is likely to leave a shoe untied. A year ago, he\u2019d be able to listen and talk and 488 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS dress, but there might be some hesitation. It was as though he needed to restart himself between tasks. Now, I have to restart him.\u201d Jason\u2019s attention span and processing capability (together, these are sometimes called working memory; see the sidebar above) were no longer up to the task of coping with the need for divided attention. A year ago, Jason could complete his task by put - ting forth some extra effort, compatible with a diagnosis (then) of mild NCD. Now, of course, his cognition had fallen further behind and he was operating at the level of an actual dementia\u2014major NCD. Learning and Memory Memory exists in many variations. Just a few years ago (it seems), we spoke mainly of long- and short-term memory. Now there\u2019s a congeries of terms that we must, um, remember. A good, simple categorization is summed up by the mnemonic PEWS: \u2022\u2022 Procedural memory. That\u2019s the sort of memory we need for skills such as typing and playing the flute (ahem!) and riding a bicycle. It",
    "and short-term memory. Now there\u2019s a congeries of terms that we must, um, remember. A good, simple categorization is summed up by the mnemonic PEWS: \u2022\u2022 Procedural memory. That\u2019s the sort of memory we need for skills such as typing and playing the flute (ahem!) and riding a bicycle. It allows us to learn a sequence of behaviors and repeat them, without having to expend conscious effort. \u2022\u2022 Episodic memory. This is the memory for events the individual has experienced as personal history\u2014the night Mom died, where you went on your last vacation, your dessert choice at supper yesterday. Episodic memory always takes our per- sonal point of view; it is often visual. \u2022\u2022 Working memory. By this we mean the very short-term storing of data that we are actively processing. We test it by asking the patient to do mental arithmetic or spell words backwards. It is often regarded as synonymous with immediate memory and regarded as an executive function. \u2022\u2022 Semantic memory . This is the type of memory we mean when we speak of gen- eral knowledge\u2014in short, facts and figures. This is where most of what we learn ends up, because we no longer associate it with anything concrete in our lives, such as where we were when the learning took place. In each division except working memory, memories tend to endure for up to many years\u2014though episodic tends to be shorter than semantic. Working memory, however, is brief (spanning but a few minutes, if that). As memory deteriorates, the time it takes to process information increases. So a person might have trouble performing mental arithmetic or repeating back a story name that was just related, or holding in mind a telephone number long enough to dial it. With advancing dementia, the little assists that once helped out lose their punch. Just before Christmas, 74-year-old Sarah had spent 2 days searching the house for the presents she had hidden. She and her son, Jon, finally found them in the stor - Symptom Domains 489 age shed, but her problems were only just beginning.

    "prided her - self on her ability to remember telephone numbers, but in February, when Jon was assigned a new extension number at work, she could never seem to recall what it was or where she had written it down. After several days of frustration, Jon finally pasted the new number onto the base of both of their telephones. However, it was the two fires she started while cooking that led to an evaluation. When asked to name the president of the United States, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you should know for yourself. I don\u2019t feel like helping you any more.\u201d By the time Audrey turned 80, she had trouble remembering where her room was; some days, she didn\u2019t recognize her daughter when she came to call. But she could still play her favorite songs on the piano. Perceptual\u2013Motor Ability Perceptual\u2013motor ability is one\u2019s ability to assimilate visual and other sensory infor - mation and use it. The use is usually motor, though also included would be facial rec - ognition, which lacks a motor component. Note that the sensory abilities themselves are just fine: The person can actually see things about as well as average, but has dif - ficulty navigating the immediate environment, especially when perceptual cues are reduced (as at twilight or nighttime). Handwork and crafts take extra effort; copying a design onto a sheet of paper could be a real problem. As with other attributes of cog - nitive functioning, problems in this domain exist on a continuum from nil to mild to major. When Jeanne moved into her senior living apartment three years ago, she relied on the sign on her door\u2014\u201cJeanne\u2019s Room\u201d\u2014to tell her where to point her walker. Now, however, she shuffles right on past the sign, unless someone is there to direct her. Agnes has an agnosia: She cannot recognize or identify familiar objects (such as the parts of a ballpoint pen), even though her sensory functioning is intact. Perceptual\u2013motor ability requires contributions from other domains\u2014 executive function- ing, for example\u2014so that there is a great deal of confusion, even among researchers who study the subject, as to exactly what domain is meant. Overlearned motor behaviors such as the use of a fork and knife are usually preserved until late in the course of a dementia.

Many different tests have been recommended, each of which is subject to various interpretations, depending on the expert you consult. c opying a simple design is one just about everyone accepts. 490 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Executive Functioning Executive functioning is the set of mechanisms people use to organize simple ideas and bits of behavior into more complex ones on the way to a goal, such as dressing or finding their way around town. When executive functioning is affected, patients have trouble interpreting new information and adapting to new situations. Planning and decision making become difficult. As mental flexibility is lost, behavior becomes driven by habit rather than by reason and feedback error correction. Sarah looks a good 10 years younger than her stated age of 75, but once again she\u2019s misbuttoned her silk blouse. She\u2019s trying to sort the laundry, but several times she just picks up an item and moves it to a different countertop. Marcus has always done the cooking in his household. (His wife is an attorney who still earns most of the money.) At age 67, he is having more and more trouble in the kitchen. He used to plan a different menu for each day of the week, but now he sticks pretty much to mac and cheese. Even so, he sometimes leaves out the salt. Twice last month he forgot the pan on the cooktop and started a small fire. Language The language domain includes both receptive language (understanding) and expressive language. The latter includes naming (the ability to state the name of an object such as a fountain pen), fluency, grammar, and syntax (structure) of language. Some patients may use circumlocutions to get around words they can\u2019t remember. Increasingly, they may come to depend on clich\u00e9s; they may become vague, circumstantial, or (in the end) completely mute. In her last years, Marcelle developed a naming aphasia: She said the word \u201cthingy\u201d for an increasing variety of objects she encountered. Several years into his dementia, Jerome now mixes up words such as table and chair.

Social Cognition Social cognition refers to the processes that help us recognize the emotions of other people and respond to them appropriately. It includes decision making, empathy, moral judgment, knowledge of social norms, emotional processing, and theory of mind \u2014the ability to imagine that other people have beliefs and desires, and to recognize that oth- ers may have ideas different from our own. A person with defects in social cognition may have difficulty recognizing the emotion portrayed in a scowling (or smiling) face. Symptom Domains 491 These people, who have damage to the amygdala, may be overly friendly toward others. Some, however, don\u2019t adhere to accepted standards of propriety or conventional social interaction. To their faces, Eileen has begun to criticize the morals of her two grandkids; they just roll their eyes and ignore her. She has distanced herself from others in her large extended family, and carries many of her meals into her bedroom to eat there alone. The others laugh and say she\u2019s had a \u201cpersonality transplant.\u201d A lifelong atheist, Harold loudly utters blasphemies even when passing a church on Sunday. He may greet parishioners with an open fly, because he often neglects to zip up. Confusion is a term often used to describe slowed thinking, loss of memory, perplexity, or disorientation in patients with ncDs. Of course you\u2019re familiar with it, because other health care providers (neurologists and internists), as well as patients and the general public, use it. DSM-5 even sneaks it in, once in a while. However, the term is inexact and, well, confus- ing; in all my writing, I\u2019ve avoided it whenever possible. Unless I get confused. Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders Whatever the underlying etiology, patients with NCD share a number of features that serve as criteria for diagnosis. Then the difference between the major and mild forms of NCD boils down to severity of the symptoms. Before getting into the criteria, let us review these several important points. Decline NCD implies loss; there is always a decline from a previous level in one or more areas of functioning. Patients who have always functioned at a low level (individuals with intellectual disability) do not necessarily have an NCD. However, like anyone else, such a person can develop an",
    "points. Decline NCD implies loss; there is always a decline from a previous level in one or more areas of functioning. Patients who have always functioned at a low level (individuals with intellectual disability) do not necessarily have an NCD. However, like anyone else, such a person can develop an NCD. In fact, many patients with Down syndrome even- tually do develop an Alzheimer\u2019s type of NCD. Even a child who suffers a decline, perhaps due the lasting effects of a traumatic brain injury, may be said to have suffered NCD. Every patient with an NCD will have a deficit in at least one of the cognitive domains discussed just above. Most patients, however, especially early in the course of a disease, won\u2019t have them all. Whereas loss of memory is paramount in Alzheimer\u2019s and some of the other degenerative disorders, it may be less prominent in patients whose underlying condition is vascular disease. Other patients may first develop prob- 492 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS lems with language, executive functioning, perceptual\u2013motor functions, or social cog - nition. But there\u2019s always decline. Overall prevalence ranges for NCD depend on exact definition and the particu - lar study quoted. As of 2013, they ranged from about 2% at age 65 to the neighbor - hood of 5\u201310% at age 75 to 15\u201330% at age 80 and above. (Actually, a Rand study in 2013 reported 15% at age 71.) Recent research suggests, however, that lifestyle changes (increased exercise, decreased smoking, improved diet) may be helping to reduce the onset of NCDs in older people. Not Exclusively a Delirium An NCD cannot be diagnosed if the symptoms occur only when the patient is delirious. However, these two conditions can (and often do) coexist, as when a patient with NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s is given medication that produces a substance intoxication delirium. Not Accounted for by Another Mental Disorder Decline of cognitive ability is sometimes associated with, for example, schizophrenia (which was once called dementia praecox \u2014early dementia). The NCD criteria state that such causes of cognitive decline must be ruled out before an NCD can be diag - nosed. Confirmed by Testing NCD criteria require that testing confirm the patient\u2019s decline. Of course, formal tests of the appropriate cognitive domain(s) are preferred, but for many patients, that\u2019s simply not going to happen. Then bedside estimates of ability will have to serve as a substitute. Testing",

Testing is especially important for patients who present as \u201cthe worried well.\u201d As people age, they notice little lapses of memory or quirks of behavior that make them wonder, \u201cAm I losing it?\u201d (Trust me on this.) Then the results of objective testing can provide the reassurance they, their relatives, and their health care providers all need to enable them to get on with their lives. There is at least one instance in which testing alone could lead us astray. That is the case of a really high- functioning person whose formal testing reveals functioning at an average, or even better, level. But for this person, who would formerly have tested off the charts, functioning at a normal level represents a substantial decline. That\u2019s why DSM-5 now emphasizes a combination of two requirements\u2014 testing and concern on the part of those who know the person. Impairment And here\u2019s the big difference between a mild NCD and a major one: In the case of a major NCD (dementia), the loss of cognitive ability must be severe enough to have Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders 493 a definite impact on the patient\u2019s work or social life. This impact doesn\u2019t have to be severe; some patients will be able to function satisfactorily with some help\u2014paying bills or shopping, for example. People with mild NCD, on the other hand, can continue to function independently if they put forth more effort. The difference between major and mild NCD, then, is one of degree. Note that for many patients, mild NCD will not progress to major NCD. The trouble is, we might not be able in advance to tell one group from the other. The onset of NCD is often gradual (though, of course, this depends a lot on the cause). The first indication may be loss of interest in work or leisure activities. Fam - ily or friends may note a change in long- standing personality traits. When executive functioning is affected, judgment and impulse control suffer. Loss of the social graces ensues, as shown when the patient makes crude jokes or neglects personal hygiene and",
    "of interest in work or leisure activities. Fam - ily or friends may note a change in long- standing personality traits. When executive functioning is affected, judgment and impulse control suffer. Loss of the social graces ensues, as shown when the patient makes crude jokes or neglects personal hygiene and appearance. Stripped of the ability to analyze, to understand, to remember, and to apply old knowledge to new situations, the patient may be left to rely upon a skeleton of habit. Patients with NCDs become increasingly vulnerable to psychosocial stresses: What would have been a minor problem a few years earlier can now assume monumen- tal proportions. Some become apathetic, some irritable; others may ignore the interests or desires of their group. Another might try to compensate for a failing memory by compulsively making lists. The misperceptions (hallucinations or illusions) so common in delirium are often absent, especially early in the process. As major NCD worsens, paranoid ideas and delusions of infidelity can lead to abusive, even assaultive behavior. Some patients are placid, especially early in the illness as apathy leads to gradu - ally reduced activity. Those who retain some insight may become depressed or anx - ious. Later, especially, a person who becomes frustrated or frightened may experience outbursts of anger. Restlessness and pacing can lead to wandering from home; patients sometimes remain lost for hours or days. A person in the final stage of major NCD may lose all useful speech and self-care, and end up confined to bed, unaware of attendants or family. Although most cases of NCD are found in older patients, it can be diagnosed any time after the age of 3 or 4, which is when a person\u2019s cognitive functioning becomes reliably measurable. The course depends on the underlying cause. Most often it is one of chronic deterioration; however, some NCDs can become static, or even remit. Remission is especially likely in NCD due to hypothyroidism, subdural hematoma, or normal- pressure hydrocephalus. When one of these causes is diagnosed early and suc- cessfully treated, full recovery can occur. The suspicion of NCD demands medical and neurological evaluation to confirm causation and, whenever possible, to intervene with treatment. In many cases, a bio - logical cause can be identified. These include primary diseases of the central ner - vous system, such as Huntington\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson\u2019s disease; infectious diseases, such as neurosyphilis",

These include primary diseases of the central ner - vous system, such as Huntington\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson\u2019s disease; infectious diseases, such as neurosyphilis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); vitamin deficiencies; tumors; trauma; various diseases of the liver, lungs, and cardiovascular system; and endocrine disorders. (A fuller listing is given in the \u201cPhysi- 494 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS cal Disorders . . .\u201d table in the Appendix.) However, some NCDs must be diagnosed not on the basis of demonstrated pathology, but by inference from clinical features and by ruling out other nonorganic causes. This is often the case with NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s or frontotemporal lobar disease. Dementia is the term formerly applied to patients with major nc D, which in some situa - tions is preferable to the older term. a good example is a young person whose cognitive problems stem from traumatic brain injury\u2014you want to call attention to a significant problem without using the pejorative term dementia. another might be the people we used to diagnose as having amnestic disorder, whose cognitive problems are generally focused on a single cognitive area. However, the terms dementia and demented are still under - stood\u2014and used\u2014by most of the world (even DSM-5 includes the term in parentheses) to denote patients we would formally diagnose as having major ncD. For convenience, not to mention my own sanity, I\u2019ll continue to use them occasionally in the rest of this chapter, but only when I want to refer to major ncD. Essential Features of {Major}{Mild} Neurocognitive Disorder Someone (the patient, a relative, the clinician) suspects that there has been a {marked}{modest} decline in cognitive functioning. On formal testing, the patient scores below accepted norms by {2+}{1\u20132} standard deviations. Alternatively, a clinical evaluation reaches the same conclusion. The symptoms {materially}{do not materially} impair the patient\u2019s ability to function independently. That is, the patient {cannot} {can} negotiate activities of daily life (paying bills, managing medications) by putting forth increased effort or using compensatory strategies such as keeping lists.

Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders 495 The wording and actual codes are given in Tables 16.1a and 16.1b. For major NCD, specify current level of severity: Mild. The patient requires help with activities of daily living, such as doing housework or managing money. Moderate. The patient needs help even with such basics as dressing and eating. Severe. The patient is fully dependent on others. Recording Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders Using Tables 16.1a and 16.1b, follow the scheme described here when you are recording a diagnosis of a major or mild NCD. A total of 10 specific (and several nonspecific) disorders are named in DSM-5, though dozens could be classified as etiological in NCD. You assign them different numbers and different descriptions, depending on whether the NCD is major or mild. Don\u2019t worry; this will become clear soon. The five etiologies in Table 16.1a can be based on a diagnosis due either to probable or possible disease, depending on the criteria that are met. In all other etiologies (Table 16.1b), there should be sufficient certainty about the cause (lab testing, imaging) that a possible diagnosis isn\u2019t necessary. Remember, keep calm. For each etiology, the first (upper) code is for the associated (causative) medical condition. The second (lower) code is for major NCD, which occupies two columns\u2014 allowing you to make, when necessary, adjustments for the patient\u2019s having a behavioral disturbance. Mild NCD offers only a single pair of codes, regardless of etiology. Easy does it. After DSM-5 was published, its editors revised the convention for naming the major NCDs. We are now advised that, wherever applicable, the possible and the prob- able labels should come just before the name of the etiological disorder, not before the NCD. After all, the reasoning goes, the fact of the NCD isn\u2019t at question\u2014it\u2019s the cause that\u2019s a bit uncertain. So ignore the formal titles as",

After all, the reasoning goes, the fact of the NCD isn\u2019t at question\u2014it\u2019s the cause that\u2019s a bit uncertain. So ignore the formal titles as printed in DSM-5, steady your nerves, and follow these examples: Major neurocognitive disorder due to {probable}{possible} Alzheimer\u2019s disease Major neurocognitive disorder due to {probable}{possible} frontotemporal lobar degeneration Major neurocognitive disorder with {probable}{possible} Lewy bodies Major neurocognitive disorder {probably}{possibly} due to vascular disease Major neurocognitive disorder {probably}{possibly} due to Parkinson\u2019s disease I\u2019m quoting exactly here from the DSM-5 website. With consistency not the watch- word of the day, I\u2019d venture that you can get away with something less than total fidelity to these examples. 496 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS 497 TABLE 16.1a.

The \u201cRecording Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders\u201d section of the text gives examples of how names should be listed. cIn mild NCD, you don\u2019t include the suspected causative factor (for example, Alzheimer\u2019s disease). That\u2019s because the level of certainty about cause is so much lower in mild than in major NCD. Also, there\u2019s no code number for behavioral distur - bance, though you should indicate it in the verbiage. Finally, for each Table 16.1a mild NCD, you can add verbiage indicat - ing whether it is probable or possible; however, there is no difference in the code number. TABLE 16.1b.

Don\u2019t ask me why; it\u2019s just another rule. By the way, I\u2019ve just read over the footnotes to Tables 16.1a and 16.1b, and I apolo- gize for their complexity. You might do better to ignore the explanations and just stare at the tables for a few minutes, or you might prefer to work your way through a couple of vignettes. I\u2019ve included enough examples throughout this chapter that things should become clear eventually. Breathe slowly. Mild ncD is a new name that comes with a lot of built-in synonyms. They include age- associated cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, age- associated memory impair- ment, and nondementia cognitive impairment . These people do not have full- fledged dementia, but they aren\u2019t exactly normal, either. although they have symptoms, their func- tional abilities are largely intact, but they need increased effort to carry them out. Don\u2019t confuse mild ncD with age- related cognitive decline, which is more or less normal (where did I put my keys?) for the person\u2019s age\u2014and which in I cD-10 no longer has diagnostic status. and don\u2019t, please, overinterpret this designation. although some patients who can be diagnosed with mild ncD will later develop",

Here\u2019s an additional quibbling note about mild ncD. The Good book tells us that if we make this diagnosis, we are not to write down code for the presumed causative agent. I find myself pushing back against this stricture. Surely, if we know that a person has had, for example, a traumatic brain injury, and that the result is a mild ncD, then we are allowed (heck, I\u2019d say obligated) to indicate as much. It is information that could be valuable to the next clinician who sees the patient, and hence it may be of considerable value to the patient. a s I understand it, the editors of DSM-5 wanted to be consistent in not writing down causes when the clinician cannot be certain of etiology, which with mild ncD is often the case. but when we have pretty darned strong evidence, our duty is to the patient, not to a book. Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease The most common cause of what was once called senility, NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s dis- ease, has been recognized since the early 1900s. Alzheimer\u2019s accounts for well over half of all dementia cases, which increase steadily with age; the majority of elderly patients in nursing homes have been stricken with this degenerative disorder. It is also common among patients over 40 who have Down syndrome. Indeed, any clinician who treats older patients is bound to encounter it frequently. Patients with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease are especially likely to have relatives with the same disorder. NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease is also important because so many other dis - orders, both cognitive and otherwise, can be mistaken for it. Despite our diagnostic advances, it is still a diagnosis of exclusion that should only be made once all other causes (especially those that can be treated) have been ruled out. Memory loss is the first symptom experienced by about half of patients with 498 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Alzheimer\u2019s, but eventually, as in other dementias, all patients will become forgetful.

    "should only be made once all other causes (especially those that can be treated) have been ruled out. Memory loss is the first symptom experienced by about half of patients with 498 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Alzheimer\u2019s, but eventually, as in other dementias, all patients will become forgetful. Recent memory (the ability to remember information that was learned within the pre - vious few minutes) is usually the first aspect to be involved; remote memory is affected later on. Patients may forget familiar names or repeatedly ask questions that have just been answered. To compensate, some write themselves notes or compile lists. Although a sense of self is generally preserved until late in the disease, severely demented patients may fail to recognize their relatives or long-time friends, and ultimately may even fail to answer to their own names. An apparent change in personality can occur early in Alzheimer\u2019s. Commonly, existing personality traits are accentuated: A patient may become more obsessional, secretive, or sexually active. Other early indications of dementia can include apathy, emotional lability (sudden weeping or temper outbursts), or the loss of a previously acute sense of humor. Loss of executive functioning (usually attributed to frontal lobe damage) can be tested directly by asking the patient to identify similarities and differences or to carry out a sequence of steps, as on the Mini- Mental State Exam (MMSE). But executive functioning is often best evaluated from the history or from observation of some of these behaviors: closely trailing the clinician or a companion (imitation behavior); fro - zen expression until prompted (lack of spontaneity), putting on more than one pair of trousers (perseveration); or repeatedly getting lost on the ward, though oriented at home (environmental dependency). The emerging picture may be that of a person who can navigate and function reasonably well in a fixed, familiar environment, but who has difficulty adapting to changing circumstances. Some patients are referred for evalua - tion only when they cannot cope with the unfamiliar surroundings of a new residence. As is true of most intellectual tasks, patients with Alzheimer\u2019s may do better when they are rested. Language functions may be manifested at first by trouble finding words (aphasia). The vocabulary contracts as clich\u00e9s and stereotyped phrases are substituted for real communication, and the patient no longer uses complex sentences. Reading and writing may deteriorate; conversation rambles. Many patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease will also have",

The vocabulary contracts as clich\u00e9s and stereotyped phrases are substituted for real communication, and the patient no longer uses complex sentences. Reading and writing may deteriorate; conversation rambles. Many patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease will also have perceptual defects such as illusions or hallucinations. They may become inordinately suspicious and develop para- noia. About 20% have depression; even those who are not depressed often experience insomnia or anorexia. Therefore, it is important to consider Alzheimer\u2019s (or other causes of dementia) in the differential diagnosis of any older patient who presents with symp- toms that suggest a depressive disorder. The typical patient lives 8 or 10 years after Alzheimer\u2019s disease begins (I knew a woman who recently died in her 14th postdiagnosis year). The clinical course, though variable, is typically a steady decline through three stages: 1. From 1 to 3 years of growing forgetfulness. 2. From 2 to 3 years of increasing disorientation, loss of language skills, and Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease 499 inappropriate behavior. Until they reach advanced stages, most patients look grossly normal, though physical exam may reveal typical \u201cfrontal release signs\u201d such as the palmomental reflex (pursing of lips when the palm is stroked\u2014 though some elderly people develop frontal release signs without having evidence of dementia). Hallucinations and delusions may appear during this stage. 3. A final period of severe dementia, during which there is disorientation for per- son and complete loss of self-care. Insight is almost always absent, and sooner or later judgment becomes impaired. At the end, complete muteness and unresponsiveness may ensue. Patients with Alzheim- er\u2019s tolerate physical illness poorly; infection or reduced nutrition that a person without the disease would shrug off may trigger a superimposed delirium. Although Alzheimer\u2019s disease is depressingly common, the etiological relationship must usually be inferred from the absence of other possible causes. Because some of these are treatable, and because Alzheimer\u2019s disease has such a dismal prognosis, it is vitally important to rule out all other possible alternatives. (DSM-5 lists NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s first, as do I; don\u2019t let this lead you astray.) although nearly every patient with dementia will have problems with memory and learning, it is only one of the six cognitive domains that can be affected by ncD.

Coding Notes Record the diagnoses and code numbers from Table 16.1a. Hank Altig Two years before Hank Altig moved to Sunny Acres, he took a job as greeter with a \u201cbig box\u201d store. He had been retired for several years, and at the age of 66, he wanted more activity. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like sitting around idle any longer,\u201d he told the screener at the preemployment physical exam. \u201cI\u2019ve still got some good years in me.\u201d Though he gave his address, Social Security number, and new cell phone number from memory, still he wondered aloud why he occasionally walked into a room and then couldn\u2019t remember why he",
    "longer,\u201d he told the screener at the preemployment physical exam. \u201cI\u2019ve still got some good years in me.\u201d Though he gave his address, Social Security number, and new cell phone number from memory, still he wondered aloud why he occasionally walked into a room and then couldn\u2019t remember why he was there. \u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d was the response. Hank\u2019s former profession (he had worked nearly 40 years as an accountant) required concentration and a high tolerance for boredom; being a greeter required Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease 501 only his presence and a willingness to smile. These he gave in good measure. \u201cEighty percent of success is just showing up,\u201d he quoted. For months, every time Hank showed up, he\u2019d carefully shaved and paid metic - ulous attention to his clothes, his shoes\u2014even his hair and nails. \u201cI want to be the greeter\u2019s greeter,\u201d he had told his daughter, Sandy, who lived just down the street and was the principal informant at his clinical assessment. But nearly a year into the job, he began to have problems. When first he\u2019d hired on, he had memorized the location of \u201chalf the items in the store.\u201d But every few days, something would get moved, and now he couldn\u2019t seem to keep the new locations in his head. Sandy bought him a tiny Moleskine notebook in which he kept track of the items people asked about most. He also used it for his appointments\u2014mostly they were din- ner dates with Sandy\u2014and other important information. Whenever Hank had trouble remembering something, Sandy would smile and say, \u201cWhere\u2019s Moley?\u201d Often Hank could look up what he wanted to know. By the time a year and a half had passed, Sandy had really begun to worry. There\u2019d been no dramatic change, just a steady slide. Once or twice when waiting for Hank to get off work, she had noticed that he seemed at first unaware when someone asked for assistance. She knew that he\u2019d been late several times, and sometimes he hadn\u2019t both - ered to shave. If she pointed it out, he\u2019d just shrug and turn away. Last week, they were back at the clinician\u2019s office. Sandy reported that Hank had stopped cooking. Mostly he ate cold cereal, unless Sandy fixed something for him and brought it over. \u201cWhere do you like to shop for groceries?\u201d asked the interviewer. With no response forthcoming, Sandy",

Mostly he ate cold cereal, unless Sandy fixed something for him and brought it over. \u201cWhere do you like to shop for groceries?\u201d asked the interviewer. With no response forthcoming, Sandy prompted, \u201cWhere\u2019s Moley?\u201d But Hank just looked blank, and the little booklet never left the pocket of his cardigan. Evaluation of Hank Altig Even when Hank first sought employment as a greeter, he was concerned about his memory. Concern (on the part of the patient or someone else) is necessary, but not sufficient, for a diagnosis of NCD of any degree. Hank\u2019s early concern was based on a common occurrence that had no clinical significance, as his clinician noted at the time. The requirement for a diagnosis is that there be concern about a decline plus objective evidence\u2014the kind that can only be obtained by actual neuropsychological testing or by \u201cbedside\u201d evaluations such as the MMSE. (We\u2019re at something of a disadvantage in this discussion because we don\u2019t have the results of testing; we\u2019ll have to interpolate a bit, as we\u2019ll do in discussions of subsequent vignettes.) In any event, we can be reasonably confident that Hank didn\u2019t have any important cognitive deficit at the time he started work. He not only quoted Woody Allen accu - rately, but his executive abilities were intact: He got himself up, nicely groomed, and to work on time, and he was able to commit to memory the locations of numerous items in the store. However, by the time months had passed, he had begun to falter. Hank was concerned, as was Sandy (NCD criterion A1), that he was having diffi - 502 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS culty learning new material. His memory wasn\u2019t quite what it had been: He appeared to have lost his former ability to memorize and recall the new locations of products in his store. However, he compensated for his difficulty with \u201cMoley,\u201d the little notebook that Sandy gave him (B), setting us up for a diagnosis of mild NCD. To complete the evalu- ation, we\u2019d need objective evidence of cognitive decline\u2014formal testing of some sort, whether a cognitive evaluation or just the MMSE done by the clinician in the office (A2).

The remaining criteria, that neither a delirium (C) nor some other mental disorder such as depression or schizophrenia (D) was present, are fulfilled in the vignette. Now we can move on to his subsequent history. By the time a year had passed, Sandy noticed that Hank\u2019s attention was wandering while on the job, and that he had begun showing up for work less well groomed than had formerly been the case\u2014 presumptive evidence for reduced executive functioning. And he was no longer com - pensating for his memory problems by using his pocket notebook. The result, as we infer from the fact that he subsequently moved into Sunny Acres, was a decline that was gradual (his entire story spanned nearly 2 years) and in important ways interfered with Hank\u2019s independent capacity to pursue the activities of everyday life (B). Now his clinician would need to complete the evaluation with a formal mental status evaluation, at least a bedside evaluation of cognitive ability such as the MMSE, and a neurological exam and enough laboratory (especially radiological) testing to pin- point, to the extent possible, the cause of his dementia. In an elderly person, you\u2019d want to rule out a traumatic brain injury by the absence of history of blows to the head; a substance- induced dementia would feature a prominent history of substance or medi- cation use. Physical exam would reveal no evidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and history and preserved affect would eliminate pseudodementia due to a depressive disorder. Skull X-rays and MRI would rule out brain tumors and normal- pressure hydrocepha- lus; blood tests would rule out hypothyroidism and vitamin B12 deficiency as possible causes. The steady rather than stepwise decline renders unlikely a vascular disease etiology, which is a common cause of dementia in the elderly. As far as we can tell from the vignette, Hank had none of the core or suggestive features that would suggest a dementia due to Lewy body disease or frontotemporal lobar degeneration. All this seems to leave NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease as the disorder of exclu - sion\u2014but would it be probable or possible?

    "dementia due to Lewy body disease or frontotemporal lobar degeneration. All this seems to leave NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease as the disorder of exclu - sion\u2014but would it be probable or possible? The DSM-5 criteria are a little finicky about this, but we can puzzle our way through them. Let\u2019s start with the time that Hank first began to have problems with mild NCD. The criteria for mild NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease would allow a probable (the stronger) diagnosis only for patients who have positive evidence from genetic testing or family history; neither condition applies to Hank. So let\u2019s examine the other evidence summarized in the Essential Features. His decline would appear to be steady; at least we have no evidence that he had ever reached some sort of plateau. Next, we should look for evidence that he had other possible etiologies for his symptoms: A couple of paragraphs above, we have discarded them all. Finally, his principal symptom was a decline in his memory and his ability to learn. Therefore, at that time he fulfilled the criterion (C) for mild NCD due to possible Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease 503 Now for the last evaluation, this one to determine the exact type of his major NCD. Once again, there\u2019s no genetic or family history to help us out. But, as noted just above, Hank did have a gradually progressive course of declining memory and learn - ing, with no evidence for mixed causes. And this time, we can find evidence of impair- ment in other cognitive domains\u2014 executive functioning and attention\u2014and formal testing might reveal still more. We\u2019ve therefore at last collected the evidence to support a diagnosis of major NCD due to probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease (also criterion C). But before we wrap up, what about behavioral disturbance? Hank didn\u2019t really respond to Sandy\u2019s last question, and he had lost interest in cooking and shaving. I\u2019d interpret this as apathy, which by the liberal DSM-5 definition (along with depression, psychosis, and agitation) constitutes behavioral disturbance. So, other than giving Hank\u2019s GAF score (twice), this is where we\u2019ll stop. First evaluation (GAF = 65): G31.84 [331.83] Mild neurocognitive disorder due to possible Alzheimer\u2019s disease, without behavioral disturbance Second evaluation (GAF = 40): G30.9 [331.0] Alzheimer\u2019s disease F02.80 [294.10] Major neurocognitive disorder due to probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease, without behavioral disturbance (apathy) Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies",

Now DLB is recognized as the second largest cause of dementia\u2014it accounts for about 15% of cases, as against 60\u201375% for Alzheimer\u2019s. There are currently well over a million such patients in the United States alone. Discovered a full century ago, Lewy bodies are spherical bits of protein (\u03b1-synuclein) found in the cytoplasm of brain cells located especially in the brainstem nuclei, substantia nigra, and locus ceruleus. Patients with DLB also frequently have amyloid plaques that are typical of Alzheimer\u2019s disease; they have clinical features of both Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases as well. Those similarities probably explain why DLB remained so obscure for so long. \u2022\u2022 Fluctuating attention . Early on, patients with DLB tend to experience less of the early memory loss that is typical for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s. Most affected are attention span and alertness, which in fact tend to wax and wane over minutes, hours, or even days in over half of patients with DLB. This fluctuation of symp- toms constitutes the first of the principal (\u201ccore\u201d) features. 504 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS \u2022\u2022 Hallucinations . The second core feature is well- formed visual hallucinations, which occur early and tend to persist. Typically, they are of animals or intruders. They can occur with or without insight, and may be accompanied by (sometimes systematized) delusions. \u2022\u2022 Later onset of Parkinson\u2019s-type symptoms. Typical motor features of Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014 immobile face, hand tremor, shuffling gait\u2014 constitute the third core symptom, but they cannot predate the dementia. If they do, the diagnosis is not DLB at all, but rather Parkinson\u2019s disease with dementia. The rule of thumb: DLB symptoms must begin at least a year before motor symptoms appear. Patients with DLB are also prone to dizziness, falls, and unexplained fainting spells. Depression is common, as is autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, incontinence of urine).

Depression is common, as is autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, incontinence of urine). REM sleep behavior disorder (see p. 343) is sometimes noted. Early diagnosis is especially important in DLB, because these patients can be exqui - sitely sensitive to neuroleptics: Relatively low doses cause muscle rigidity, fever, and other symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. DLB typically begins around age 75; men are affected somewhat more often than are women. After diagnosis, the typical patient lives about 10 years. It isn\u2019t at all clear that Parkinson\u2019s dementia and DLb are different entities; some authori- ties believe that they exist on a continuum. They both involve \u03b1 -synuclein protein and degeneration of the substantia nigra of the brain. b oth feature Parkinson\u2019s motor symp - toms, though with disparate timing: For a diagnosis of DL b, the movement disorder must show up only after cognitive symptoms have been present for a year or more. Preexisting movement disorder shifts the diagnosis to Parkinson\u2019s dementia. Of course, this creates something of a dilemma for the clinician who needs to make a diagnosis now, using as a criterion something that hasn\u2019t occurred yet. a ctually, not all of these patients do develop the motor symptoms of parkinsonism. and you only need two of the core features to diagnosis the probable form of the disease. Finally, there can be no definitive diagnosis without pathological verification. Essential Features of Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies The patient has a {major}{mild} neurocognitive disorder (p. 492). Beginning slowly and progressing gradually, the disease has these core features: wide fluctuation in attentiveness; elaborate, clear hallucinations; and symptoms of parkinsonism that begin a year or more after the cognitive symptoms. Some patients have features that suggest DLB: REM sleep behavior disorder, marked sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs.

Sheila Wilton \u201cDr. Brantleigh said she had schizophrenia,\u201d Sophia reported. Sophia was Sheila Wil - ton\u2019s grown stepdaughter, and she provided most of the historical information. The shape of her lips said she didn\u2019t believe Dr. Brantleigh. The problems had begun about 3 months earlier, when Sheila had trouble find - ing her way back from the store. She\u2019d shopped at the Safeway on the corner for many years, but twice now she\u2019d apparently turned left instead of right, and ended up many blocks astray. The first time, a policeman brought her home. The second, a neighbor recognized her and called Sophia, who came and got her. \u201cAt first, she seemed fuzzy, confused,\u201d Sophia lamented, \u201cbut when I asked her later to tell me our address and such, she responded with all the facts.\u201d A few days later, Sophia found Sheila sitting on the edge of the bed in her room, talking to a vivid hallucination of her husband standing beside her. \u201cHe was motioning 506 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS to me to get up and fix breakfast,\u201d was what Sheila had finally been able to relate. \u201cAnd Dad\u2019s been dead for 7 years,\u201d Sophia finished up. They\u2019d gone to their local medical provider, who, finding nothing wrong, referred Sheila for psychological evaluation.

    "the doctor had netted a prescription for haloperidol, \u201cand then all hell broke loose.\u201d Sheila\u2019s quiet little hallucination turned hostile. Still using mime, her phantom husband now threatened, her sometimes with a closed fist, sometimes with the heavy walking stick he had always carried. She responded first with agitation, then with fury that ultimately dwindled into perplexity that seemed to wax and wane. Within a day or two, she became overly sedated, then rigid\u2014so stiff she could hardly walk. \u201cNow they\u2019re saying she\u2019s catatonic and needs shock treatments,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cI don\u2019t under- stand it. No one in her family has ever had any sort of mental illness.\u201d Off and on during the day, Sheila would be confused, at times not knowing where she was. But in the doctor\u2019s office she was fully oriented, missing the correct date by only 2 days. \u201cThat\u2019s about as well as I can do,\u201d remarked Sophia. \u201cBut it\u2019s so typical of the way she\u2019s been\u2014first out of it, then back in. The implication was that she was doing it for all the attention I was giving her. Brantleigh used the word malingering.\u201d Evaluation of Sheila Wilton Let\u2019s for a moment put aside the hallucinations and focus instead on the domains of Sheila\u2019s other cognitive symptoms. These were perceptual\u2013motor (aside from the hal - lucinations, she couldn\u2019t find her way home) and complex attention (she had fluctuating awareness). We\u2019d have to do formal testing to get a number to put on the extent of her decline, but from this and the other information in the vignette, I\u2019d judge her clinically as being moderately impaired, thereby earning a diagnosis of major NCD. Her symp - toms interfered with her independence\u2014at least for such important activities of daily living as working around the house and managing money. It would appear that she was able to feed and dress herself, so her current level of severity would be mild. (Note the distinction: She would have mild major NCD, not mild NCD. That semantic nightmare is bound to cause some clinicians heartburn.) And while we\u2019re talking about the basic NCD diagnosis, let\u2019s consider the specifi- ers. Sheila did have rather pronounced hallucinations, which would earn her the quali- fier with behavioral disturbance (hallucinations) .

    "NCD diagnosis, let\u2019s consider the specifi- ers. Sheila did have rather pronounced hallucinations, which would earn her the quali- fier with behavioral disturbance (hallucinations) . Though we could mount a cogent argument for a neurological consultation, there wouldn\u2019t appear to be other medical disorders, and certainly not other mental disor - ders (the diagnosis of schizophrenia was obviously bogus), that could better explain her symptoms. In short, she would appear to have some sort of a dementia. But which one? First, a couple of facts\u2014 sobering ones for those who would like to achieve cer - tainty while life endures. For many patients with dementia, only the fullness of time (read: a postmortem examination) can deliver a final, accurate diagnosis. And even with imaging and laboratory information, discriminating one form of dementia from another can be devilishly hard. But here goes. Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies 507 Sheila had had no history of traumatic brain injury, so we can pretty well rule out dementia due to that cause. She didn\u2019t have early and prominent difficulties with her memory, so we can put Alzheimer\u2019s aside (though it would not be completely off the radar). There was neither hypertension nor stepwise progression of her symptoms, rendering unlikely a vascular cause. History and physical symptoms were inconsistent with Huntington\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, or HIV infection. The criteria for two types of fron - totemporal NCD are infuriatingly complicated, as I\u2019ll discuss later, but neither her behavior nor her language appeared to have deteriorated enough to sustain a diagnosis of either subtype. Of course, that still leaves many other disorders that can cause dementia, but our diagnostic foray shouldn\u2019t be one exclusively of elimination. There are affirmative rea - sons to consider NCD with Lewy bodies \u2014in Sheila or in any patient. The main one is that there is an immediate important implication for treatment. This is the risk that using antipsychotic drugs can lead, as it apparently did in Sheila\u2019s case, to worsening of the cognitive symptoms and the physical symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syn - drome. (That\u2019s one of the suggestive symptoms of DLB.) In addition, she had the wide fluctuations in alertness and attention and the well- formed hallucinations that consti - tute core features. For a diagnosis of probable major NCD with Lewy bodies, Sheila would need at least one core symptom plus at least one other (core or suggestive); Sheila had",
    "In addition, she had the wide fluctuations in alertness and attention and the well- formed hallucinations that consti - tute core features. For a diagnosis of probable major NCD with Lewy bodies, Sheila would need at least one core symptom plus at least one other (core or suggestive); Sheila had two core and one suggestive, more than enough for her working diagnosis. I\u2019d put her GAF score (at her current level of functioning) as 45, but I wouldn\u2019t disagree if you argued for a different value. She\u2019d been all over the map. The narrative of Sheila Wilton includes two of my differential diagnosis b\u00eates noires \u2014 malingering and schizophrenia. It\u2019s not that they never happen; of course they do. but they are two \u201cexplanations\u201d that clinicians sometimes use to get themselves off the hook for symptoms that are hard to evaluate, hard to understand, hard to treat, and hard to view optimistically. Each of these diagnoses appears late in my evaluative process. G31.83 [331.82] Lewy body disease F02.81 [294.11] Major neurocognitive disorder with probable Lewy bodies, mild, with behavioral disturbance (hallucinations) Neurocognitive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury Each year in the United States, more than a million people suffer a blow to the head or some other injury that ushers in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Though most cases of TBI are mild, the damage from war and sports injuries can be devastating. And of course, a few percent die as a result of their injuries. 508 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS The largest number of patients with TBI are adolescents or young adults (males predominate); the elderly, because they injure themselves in falls, are the next most affected age group. Low socioeconomic status is another risk factor, but the biggest risk of all is use of alcohol and drugs\u2014which contribute to nearly half of TBIs. Motor vehi- cle accidents (including those that strike pedestrians) are the leading proximate cause; falls (especially in the elderly) are second. Sports injuries are an important source for younger people (women athletes are more likely to be affected than are men). The symptoms of TBI are caused by a disruption of brain structure or physiology that results from external force exerted upon the head. Immediate loss of consciousness is usual; after awakening, patients may have trouble focusing and maintaining attention. Delirium is common; even after it clears, deficits in attention are commonplace. Many patients complain of",
    "caused by a disruption of brain structure or physiology that results from external force exerted upon the head. Immediate loss of consciousness is usual; after awakening, patients may have trouble focusing and maintaining attention. Delirium is common; even after it clears, deficits in attention are commonplace. Many patients complain of trouble with memory (anterograde or retrograde). Language func- tions affect about a third of patients with severe TBI. These especially include fluent (receptive) aphasias, though nonfluent (expressive) aphasias are also well represented. Executive functioning is commonly affected. Patients with TBI will also complain of problems with sleep, headaches, and irritability. Though it can take months, most patients eventually recover. But common sequels include depressive disorders (most frequent), anxiety disorders, and substance misuse. Personality change is sometimes noted. A preinjury mental disorder greatly increases the risk for a postinjury disorder. And TBI, especially if repeated, may increase the likelihood of Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014 perhaps by as much as fourfold. Some writers note that the differentiation of NCD due to TBI from posttraumatic stress disorder can be challenging. chronic traumatic encephalopathy doesn\u2019t fit neatly into the T bI paradigm, caused as it is by repeated injury to the brain. It\u2019s associated with contact sports such as boxing (then, it\u2019s sometimes called dementia pugilistica ), american football, soccer, ice hockey, rugby, and even professional wrestling. Symptoms\u2014which include failing memory, aggression, poor impulse control, parkinsonism, depression, and suicide\u2014have been found, tragically, in athletes as young as 17. at least two professional football players, apparently realizing that their brains had been damaged by repetitive playing injuries, have killed themselves, carefully choosing means that would preserve their brains for postmortem examination. The phenomenon makes for riveting scientific studies, television specials, and lawsuits.

Thornton Naguchi When Thornton Naguchi arrived home, his reception wasn\u2019t what he or anyone in his family had imagined. The brass band and confetti (his fantasy) were missing; on the other hand, so was the pine box, which was what his mother had feared all along. \u201cShe\u2019s a firm believer in Murphy\u2019s law\u2014if something can go wrong, it will,\u201d he told the inter- viewer at the VA hospital where he stayed for a few days. Thornton\u2019s grandparents had been interned in Idaho during World War II, leaving his grandfather extremely bitter, often railing against the government. He was some - thing of a tyrant; Thornton\u2019s revenge had been to join the military as soon as he was of age. Within a few months, the Army had posted him to \u201ca part of Iraq so remote they\u2019d never heard of tofu.\u201d During Thornton\u2019s first week in country, as he was riding in the last non-up- armored Humvee in the unit, they\u2019d hit an improvised explosive device. A shard of metal had sliced right through his helmet strap as he was launched into the air, and he fell back squarely on his head. When he awakened nearly 24 hours later, he remem - bered starting off on the mission\u2014but nothing of the actual explosion. It was his ser - geant who\u2019d reconstructed it for him. After the accident he\u2019d been grateful to be alive, but he initially had some trouble focusing even on watching TV. Though he had always been bright and personable, he was cross, snapping at a nurse who suggested that he could get up and change the chan- nel for himself. While he was still awaiting his discharge papers, Thornton got a job selling cell phones at an electronics outlet near his home. He\u2019d grown up with electronic devices and had kept current with the industry while he was in the Army, so he had little trouble demonstrating the basic features of smart phones.

But holding in mind the nuances of the different models was a chore\u2014far more so for him than for the other young people who worked with him. \u201cI needed a crib sheet\u2014on my phone\u2014just to keep up,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re talking 15 or 20 different models here, not to mention the tablets.\u201d If he was talking to a customer and a co- worker asked an incidental question, he found that he\u2019d lose his train of thought 510 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS completely. \u201cI\u2019d have to ask the customer where we were. I know it cost me bonus money.\u201d Thornton lived with Yuki, his girlfriend of 4 years. She reported that he seemed distracted, \u201cforever drifting out of the picture,\u201d as she put it. He wasn\u2019t really depressed, she thought, but cranky and impulsive, occasionally flinging on his clothes and slam - ming out the door. When he returned, he\u2019d say that he just walked. \u201cAnd he just freaks out at loud noises.\u201d That was apparently what happened one afternoon as he was installing curtains in their apartment. Yuki dropped a pan lid in the kitchenette, not 10 feet from where he was standing on a ladder. He jerked, overbalanced, and fell hard on the terrazzo floor. \u201cMurphy was an optimist,\u201d he\u2019d told the paramedics who loaded him up for his second ambulance ride in 6 months. Evaluation of Thornton Naguchi The first step in the diagnosis of any NCD, major or mild, is to ascertain that there has been some decline from previous functioning. This appeared to be the case for Thorn- ton, who needed help remembering the different types of cell phone he was supposed to be selling. He managed to avert significant interference with his work by keeping a crib sheet\u2014the extra effort required to compensate for his problems with memory. He had also been irritable, perhaps a sign of a mild decline in the social cognition domain. And there were also some minor problems with his executive functioning, as suggested by the trouble he had picking up on an interrupted conversation.

Formal testing would probably confirm these modest declines in his cognitive abil- ities (mild NCD criterion A2), but even without it, a diagnosis of mild NCD could be sustained on the basis of a clinical interview. He had continued to support himself (B), wasn\u2019t delirious (C), and didn\u2019t have another mental disorder (D). Now for the TBI bit. Of course, the sine qua non of TBI is trauma, which in Thorn- ton\u2019s case was well established. After the blow to his head, he had suffered both uncon- sciousness and amnesia for the event; either of those would complete his diagnostic criteria (criterion B for NCD due to TBI). Long afterwards (certainly well past the immediate postinjury period\u2014 criterion C), he remained irritable and unfocused, with- out definite symptoms of a mood disorder. Still, I don\u2019t think that his emotional or behavioral sequelae rise to the level of the with behavioral disturbance specifier. Based on how long he was unconscious, the duration of his amnesia, and his disori- entation and bewilderment at initial assessment, DSM-5 permits us to rate the sever - ity of his TBI. Quite frankly, I consider this one too many numbers: * What we really care about is Thornton, not his injury. Prior to his latest fall, his GAF would have been a comparatively robust 71. I hope that he wouldn\u2019t now develop chronic traumatic encephalitis (see the sidebar above). Assuming a \u201cno,\u201d his diagnosis would be as follows: *Ratings of TBI severity may be helpful in doing research on head injury sequels. If you want to know more, you can see p. 626 of DSM-5. I won\u2019t discuss it further here. I have my standards.

    "I\u2019ll use the tra - ditional abbreviation for frontotemporal dementia (FTD)\u2014used to be considered rare. Now, it\u2019s known to account for up to 5% of all cases of dementia and perhaps one in six younger patients: Its mean age of onset is somewhere in the 50s. FTD appears to respect neither gender nor race, but it is often familial; about half of cases are transmit- ted as an autosomal dominant trait. You won\u2019t be surprised to hear that FTD affects frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (which lose neurons and accumulate tau protein); in so doing, it can produce diverse clinical pictures. The behavioral variant is characterized either by apathy and social withdrawal or by disinhibition. Apathetic folks basically stay in bed and stop providing their own care, whereas the disinhibited ones do things that are socially inappropriate\u2014make rude sexual comments, for example, or steal items or otherwise subvert social norms. In both types, though, it\u2019s the behavior that you notice. The language variant often begins with patients unable to find the right word (ano- mia) for a particular object or concept\u2014though they can point to the correct object when it is presented to them. Reading aloud and understanding of spoken language are both initially unimpaired, but with time, they may become increasingly unable to produce fluent, meaningful speech. Both the behavioral and the language types begin insidiously and progress slowly, with relative sparing of memory and visuoperceptual skills. Both culminate in compromised activities of daily living. As they progress, the boundaries of the two subtypes become less distinct. In part because of variability and overlapping features, the syndromes of FTD often go unrecognized. Final diagnosis depends heavily on imaging and neuropsycho - logical testing. Here we\u2019ll focus on a couple of vignettes to illustrate what you might expect to confront in patients who haven\u2019t yet received the necessary workup. as Pick\u2019s disease, FTD is a venerable diagnosis, dating back to the 1890s. It is remarkable how similar its symptoms are to what was for many years called simple schizophrenia , which was retained in the official nomenclature until 1980. Here is the DSM-II description: It is \u201ccharacterized chiefly by a slow and insidious reduction of external attachments and interests and by apathy and indifference leading to impoverishment of interpersonal rela - tions, mental deterioration, and adjustment on a lower level of functioning.\u201d The entry goes on to explain",

The symptoms begin slowly and progress gradually. The patient\u2019s symptoms will be mainly of one of these two types: Behavioral variant. The patient behaves in socially inappropriate ways that may include poor manners, loss of decorum, or rash impulsivity; apathy or iner- tia; reduced capacity for compassion; compulsive behavior; and hyperorality (binge eating, pica, drinking, smoking) and alterations of diet. Visuomotor skills will be relatively unimpaired, but there tends to be clear evidence of impaired frontal/executive functioning, such as reduced mental flexibility, decreased generation tasks, planning deficits, and reversal learning errors. Language variant. In the face of relatively unimpaired memory and visuomotor function, there is gradual loss of the ability to produce speech, to find the right word, to attach names to objects, and to use grammar and under - stand the meaning of words.

Toby Russo The telephone request came from a man in Chicago, who was worried about his dad. \u201cWhen I saw him over the holidays, he wasn\u2019t himself,\u201d the caller began. \u201cFor a long time, maybe a year, he\u2019s been losing interest in things.

He said my dad only just shrugged and pock- Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder 513 eted his final pay envelope. That was 6 months ago.\u201d Since then, he\u2019d apparently had a number of car accidents, but he kept right on driving. The caller ended by asking the clinician to pay a home visit to his dad, who had refused to make an office appointment. While talking with the clinician, Toby Russo sat in his apartment and stuffed his mouth with Cheetos. He admitted that his weight had shot up in the past couple of years, though he didn\u2019t much care. In mute affirmation, about him lay empty Chee - tos bags and cereal boxes. His shirt was gray around the neckline and badly frayed; he didn\u2019t appear to have showered recently. But both his recent and remote memory appeared intact, and he wasn\u2019t depressed; he\u2019d had no delusions or hallucinations. The car accidents? He just ran into a lot of other vehicles; no problem. Maybe he\u2019d get his car fixed, only they\u2019d stopped his insurance. However, on simple testing (the MMSE), he scored 28 out of a possible 30, missing the day of the week and one of the three objects he\u2019d been asked to remember. Toby had been sleeping in his living room on a mattress tossed onto the floor. Beside it lay a tattered pair of boxer shorts covered in\u2014just what were those spots and blotches, the clinician wanted to know. \u201cI smoke, so I have to cough a lot,\u201d Toby explained blandly. \u201cIn the night, I don\u2019t want to get up, so I just spit it there.\u201d He guessed that the same shorts had lain there, night after night, maybe for weeks. Within days, Toby had slipped rapidly downhill. His son, again visiting in town, had found him alone in his apartment. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t stirred from his mattress for a day or two.

Trudy Cantor At her 60th birthday party, Trudy Cantor\u2019s brother had noticed that she hesitated\u2014 maybe stammered was a better word\u2014a bit when responding to the toast. She\u2019d repeat- edly seemed to struggle to find the right word (\u201cYes, that\u2019s it. Happy ,\u201d she\u2019d say at a helpful suggestion; her relief was evident.) Then she\u2019d joke, \u201cMy senior moments are growing together.\u201d That was 2 years earlier. Now, though she could read aloud from a printed source, her spontaneous speech was rambling and she never managed to convey any point. \u201cHere\u2019s the way it\u2019s been. I first wanted to get, um, no that\u2019s not right, I thought it was another thing. Most of the time, I\u2019ve been quite, uh, quite, you know, well . . . that\u2019s just the way it is.

Evaluation of Toby Russo and Trudy Cantor Each of these patients had long- standing cognitive changes that would qualify for a diagnosis of major NCD (frontotemporal NCD criterion A). And each had a personal 514 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS history of gradually deteriorating (B) cognitive status that, at least initially, was not remarkable for memory impairment. In Toby\u2019s case, there were signs of apathy (criterion C1a-ii), as well as behavioral disinhibition (repeatedly crashing his car and not caring,\u2014C1a-i) and hyperorality (stuffing himself on Cheetos, though other people will smoke or drink to excess, or just put objects into their mouths,\u2014C1a-v). From the results on the MMSE, his memory and perceptual\u2013motor functions were probably relatively spared at the time of his ini - tial evaluation (D, though one wonders what was happening that repeatedly caused him to crash his car). It was only with his deteriorating status that the definitive MRI was forthcoming (probable frontotemporal NCD criterion 2), which allowed us to state that his diagnosis was, um, probable.

DSM-5 would allow us to add \u201cwith behavioral disturbance\u201d to Toby\u2019s diagnosis, but under the circumstance that would seem a little silly, but it lets us state the behavior type. Because his was a probable case, we list first the medical diagnosis. With a GAF score of 10, Toby\u2019s diagnosis would be as follows: G31.09 [331.19] Frontotemporal disease F02.81 [294.11] Major neurocognitive disorder due to probable frontotemporal lobar degeneration, behavioral variant, severe, with behavioral disturbance (apathy and disinhibition) Over the years, Trudy had experienced a remarkable loss of her language skills, beginning with problematic word finding and gradually (criterion B) progressing to speech that was normally produced but content-free (C2a). The fact that she was still able to work at drafting indicates sparing of perceptual\u2013motor functioning (D); to eval- uate whether her ability to learn was spared would require some testing. However, her problems with language were serious, far past the level of mild NCD. Therefore, on clinical grounds (with a GAF score somewhere in the 50s, I feel her diagnosis should be possible (no testing, no genetic information) major frontotemporal NCD. Though she had terrible problems with communication, she didn\u2019t require help with instrumental activities of daily living, so I\u2019d rate her overall severity as mild. G31.09 [331.19] Frontotemporal disease F02.80 [294.10] Major neurocognitive disorder due to possible frontotemporal lobar degeneration, language variant, without behavioral disturbance, mild Wait a minute: There isn\u2019t anything in Table 16.1a about stating language variant or behav- ioral variant, is there? a nd the answer is, of course, \u201c no, but there should be.\u201d It is addi- tional information that may be of value to the patient and to later clinicians, so I went right ahead and put it in. There\u2019s no code number attached, so what\u2019s the problem? Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder 515 Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder Approximately 10% of dementias have a vascular origin. Vascular dementia has also been called multi- infarct dementia because its presumed cause is so often a series of strokes, though some patients are affected by a single event and others may have small vessel disease that doesn\u2019t produce infarcts. Whereas patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease deteriorate gradually, many patients with vascular NCD worsen through a series of small steps as the strokes occur. Sometimes, however, progression",
    "a series of strokes, though some patients are affected by a single event and others may have small vessel disease that doesn\u2019t produce infarcts. Whereas patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease deteriorate gradually, many patients with vascular NCD worsen through a series of small steps as the strokes occur. Sometimes, however, progression can appear slow and gradual\u2014 probably due to the accumulating involvement of multiple small vessels. Vas- cular NCD is especially likely to develop in a patient who has diabetes or hypertension. Besides failing memory, patients experience the loss of executive functioning, which (as noted above) can show up as the inability to deal with novel tasks. Apathy, slowed thinking, and deteriorating hygiene are also often noted. Relatively mild stress- ors may precipitate pathological laughing or crying. These patients are less likely than patients with Alzheimer\u2019s to have aphasia, apraxia, and agnosia, though any aspect of mental functioning can be affected. The symptoms of vascular NCD depend on the exact location of brain lesion(s), but several characteristics are typical, especially of what\u2019s known as subcortical ischemic vascular disease . They include early impairment of executive function and attention, slowed motor performance, and slowed processing of information. Episodic memory is less affected than in Alzheimer\u2019s, but mood symptoms (depression, lability) and apathy are especially prominent. In naturalistic studies, the rate of advance of vascular NCD is about the same as for Alzheimer\u2019s; illness in treated patients progresses more slowly. Some authorities advocate a division of dementias into the cortical (or degenerative, such as dementia due to alzheimer\u2019s disease) and sub- cortical (dementia due to most other causes). The subcortical dementias (some texts also call these secondary dementias) are allegedly less likely to produce agnosia, apraxia, and aphasia. Other authorities object, pointing out that the pathology of disease is never that neat and that all dementias have some degree of both cortical and subcortical pathology. because there is so much overlap in symptoms, DSM-5\u2019s seems the safer classification. It categorizes the ncDs much more simply, on the basis of presumed underlying cause. 516 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Essential Features of Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder The patient has a {mild}{major} neurocognitive disorder (p. 492).

Minnie Bell Leach At their family physician\u2019s request, her daughter and son-in-law had brought Minnie Bell Leach for consultation. She had lived with them for the past year, since her second stroke. Nearly 5 years earlier, her first stroke had left her with a partly paralyzed left leg, but she had been able to care for herself and even do her marketing until the second stroke a year ago. Since then, she had rarely left her wheelchair. Her daughter provided an increasing share of her personal care. Over the last few months, Minnie Bell had begun to slip. At first she often forgot to take her medicine for high blood pressure. Despite the fact that she kept them in their container (which had three compartments for each day of the week), she had at first needed reminding to take the pills at breakfast, lunch, and bedtime. After a week or two, this had improved, and for a time she had seemed almost back to her former self. But when she awakened the previous Sunday morning, it was clear that Minnie Bell had slipped some more. She had neglected to zip her skirt and had gotten the buttons of her blouse into the wrong holes. Neither of these mistakes did she seem to notice. She also had trouble expressing herself\u2014at breakfast she asked for \u201cred stuff\u201d for her toast (it was strawberry jam that she and her daughter had made together last summer). And she had reverted to taking her medicine only when reminded. Minnie Bell looked a bit older than her 68 years. She sat quietly in her wheelchair, cradling her left wrist in her right hand.

She sat quietly in her wheelchair, cradling her left wrist in her right hand. Over her cotton house dress she wore a cloth overcoat that had fallen off one shoulder; she did not appear to notice. Although she Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder 517 maintained good eye contact throughout the consultation, she spoke only when spoken to. Her speech was clear and coherent. She denied having hallucinations, delusions, or depression, but she spontaneously complained of a cough, shortness of breath, and numerous aches and pains. She overlooked the fact that she couldn\u2019t walk. On the MMSE, Minnie Bell scored 20 out of 30. She knew the year but missed the month and date by over 2 months; she could name the city and state, a watch, and a pencil. Although she could repeat the names of three objects (ball, chair, telephone) immediately after she heard them, 5 minutes later she could recall only the ball. She became confused when asked to follow the three-part instruction, and she persistently forgot to place the folded paper on the floor. There were no apraxias: She could use a pencil to copy a simple figure. On neurological exam, Minnie Bell\u2019s left hand was weak; there was an abnormal Babinski sign (upgoing great toe when the sole of her foot was scratched) on that side. Evaluation of Minnie Bell Leach The evidence for Minnie Bell\u2019s having an NCD was as follows: She had had increasing difficulty with her memory, as shown by the history of forgetting to take her medication and by the obvious problem with short-term memory. From the MMSE, she appeared to have no agnosias or apraxias. However, her daughter noted the aphasia of \u201cred stuff\u201d for jam (a language problem). She also had increasing problems with executive func - tioning, as shown by her neglected appearance and her inability to follow a three-step instruction. These problems represented a major decline from her previous level of functioning, and they did interfere at least moderately with her everyday life. The prolonged course of her disease would also argue against delirium. Minnie Bell denied depression, delusions, or hallucinations, rendering unlikely the diagnosis of a noncognitive disorder such as a pseudodementia (vascular NCD criterion D).

Minnie Bell denied depression, delusions, or hallucinations, rendering unlikely the diagnosis of a noncognitive disorder such as a pseudodementia (vascular NCD criterion D). A vascular etiology for her disease was suggested by her history of hypertension and by the stepwise progression of her disability following several strokes (B1). Her neurological signs (weak- ness of her hand, upgoing toe) from the start of her decline provided further evidence for a vascular etiology (C). Her clinical course supports a probable vascular etiology (B2). Because Minnie Bell\u2019s principal symptom seemed to be trouble with executive functioning, she would be diagnosed as follows (with a GAF score of 31: F01.50 [290.40] Major vascular neurocognitive disorder probably due to vascular disease, without behavioral disturbance, moderate Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Other Medical Conditions Also detailed in DSM-5 are several other causes of NCD, most of which are responsible for just a tiny percentage of total cases. Below, I\u2019ve summarized the features to look for in those accorded specific criteria in DSM-5. A more complete list can be found in the \u201cPhysical Disorders . . . \u201d table in the Appendix. 518 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Parkinson\u2019s disease. The stooped posture, slow movements, rigidity, back-and- forth (\u201cpill- rolling\u201d) tremor, and rapid, shuffling gait characteristic of Parkinson\u2019s disease are well known and often obvious. Less well known may be the degree to which NCD occurs\u2014 affecting a quarter or more of patients with Parkinson\u2019s, with the likelihood of major NCD increasing to as high as 75% with advancing age. Note that in contrast to dementia with Lewy bodies, the physical aspects of Parkinson\u2019s appear before the cognitive features appear. That\u2019s one leg of two qual- ifying factors for a probable or possible diagnosis. The other is that there must be no evidence that another disorder\u2014 cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, or any other mental, neurological, or physical disease\u2014is contributing to the develop - ment of the NCD. Presence of both factors yields a probable diagnosis; presence of only one yields a possible diagnosis. See Table 16.1a for details of recording. Huntington\u2019s disease.

Age of onset for Huntington\u2019s disease averages around 40 years; the first symptoms may be apparently minor changes in personality and executive functioning, followed by deteriorating memory and judgment. A gener- alized restlessness may precede the characteristic involuntary choreiform move - ments and slowing of voluntary movements. Prevalence is about 6 per 100,000 in North America and Europe. The cause is an autosomal dominant gene on chromo- some 4. Prion disease. Prion disease is at once miniscule and huge. It accounts for a tiny fraction of all dementias\u2014 perhaps 1 case per million population per year\u2014yet its \u201cmad cow disease\u201d form is so dramatic (and unusual) that it makes headlines whenever it occurs. The more common type, Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, is caused by an infectious protein that contains no nucleic acids (that is, no DNA or RNA). These diseases attack the brain, creating the holes in microscopic sections that account for the collective name spongiform encephalopathies . Symptoms include memory loss, hallucinations, personality change, and motor problems. Though the age range is wide, it usually occurs in the elderly; a few cases are familial. Usually fatal within a year, prion disease is essentially untreatable. HIV infection. Improvements in antiviral therapy have reduced the various threats posed by HIV infection; yet up to half of those infected will have some symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, and up to a third meet criteria for mild or major NCD. It is principally a subcortical type of infection with a variable presentation. Although HIV infection is not one of the more common causes of dementia, it has rapidly become one of the most important, occurring in young people and laying waste otherwise vigorous lives. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve used it below as the exemplar for this NCD category. Other causes. The symptoms and course of illness depend heavily on the underly- ing medical cause. Obviously, so do treatment and prognosis. They might include normal- pressure hydrocephalus. hypothyroidism, brain tumor, vitamin B12 defi - ciency, and many others. See Appendix A for more.

Coding Notes See Tables 16.1a and 16.1b for coding procedures. Arlen Wing When he was admitted to the hospital for the third time in 4 months, Arlen Wing had lost 30 pounds, which was nearly 20% of his body weight. With it seemed to have gone much of his will to live: He had often neglected to take the cocktail of antiviral medica- tions prescribed to shore up his failing immune system. This, plus the apathy that was so obvious on admission, prompted the request for mental health consultation. Arlen\u2019s physician noted that a CT brain scan showed diffuse cortical atrophy; an EEG had been read as indicating \u201cnonfocal slowing.\u201d Arlen had trained to be a dancer. After he just missed landing a job with the Jof - frey Ballet, he had joined his long-time companion, Alex, in the business of buying and 520 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS selling antique dolls. The two had made a good living traveling around the country to auctions and doll shows, until Alex rather suddenly died of Pneumocystis pneumonia. Arlen soon discovered that he was HIV-positive; he promptly began taking prophylactic medications. He had continued to operate his business until the last few months, when his CD4 cell count dropped below 200, triggering his recent series of hospitalizations. While the consultant explained the purpose of the visit, Arlen made eye contact and listened politely. His speech was slow and labored, but there were no other abnor- malities in the flow of his speech. He had no delusions, hallucinations, or other abnor- mal content of thought.

He denied feeling especially sad or anxious\u2014\u201cjust tired.\u201d Arlen knew his own name, the name of the hospital, and the month, but he gave the date and year incorrectly. He thought that he had been admitted only the day before, whereas it had actually been a week earlier. He could not recall the name of the physician who had attended him for the past 3 years. He scored only 14 out of 30 on the MMSE. When asked to pick up a sheet of paper, fold it, and put it on the floor, he twice dropped the paper unfolded onto the floor. When asked to tell how an apple and an orange were similar, he could offer no response. Although he acknowledged being seriously ill, he admitted that recently he had often neglected to take his cocktail of pills. \u201cI was feeling terrible,\u201d he said, \u201cand I thought they might be making me sick.\u201d Evaluation of Arlen Wing Arlen\u2019s history and obvious intellectual decline (major NCD criterion A) point clearly to the NCDs. He was alert, and he adequately focused his attention on the exam, making a delirium extremely unlikely (C). (However, the trouble he had pursuing a task or shift- ing attention from one task to another can occur later in the course of NCD due to HIV infection.) His loss of recent memory was obvious; this is especially common in an HIV- related dementia. Also typical were his apathy and slowed speech (slowed-down motor movements in general are characteristic of this disorder). His impairments represented a significant decline from his previous level of functioning (B). There were no obvious agnosias, apraxias, or aphasias, which is what we\u2019d expect from a non- Alzheimer\u2019s type of dementia. In all, he clearly conformed to the criteria for an NCD, and his HIV- positive status would provide the necessary information as to etiology. We note that Arlen had the behavioral disturbance of apathy. Because he had given up on self-care, I would score his GAF as only 21, though other clinicians might rate him somewhat higher. The severity rating for his major NCD would be less dire; he wasn\u2019t yet fully dependent for all care. Informants who knew him well would be the most satisfactory source of informa - tion about Arlen\u2019s",

Informants who knew him well would be the most satisfactory source of informa - tion about Arlen\u2019s executive functioning (had he been having trouble dressing himself, shopping, or taking care of other routine daily tasks?). However, his inability to follow a sequence of events in the MMSE also provided evidence. Discontinuing his medica- tions suggested a lapse in judgment, typical of the later stages of an HIV-related demen- tia. He denied feeling depressed\u2014 evidence (though not definitive) against a mood dis- order with pseudodementia. Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Other Medical Conditions 521 B20 [042] HIV infection F02.81 [294.11] Major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, moderate, with behavioral disturbance Substance/Medication- Induced Neurocognitive Disorder NCDs can result from prolonged use of alcohol, sedatives, and inhalants, though in the vast majority of instances, alcohol is the chief culprit. Patients will have difficulty with constructional tasks (e.g., drawing), behavioral problems, and memory defects. These patients are often described as having delusional jealousy or hallucinations. Although the onset is typically gradual, nothing may be noted amiss until the patient has dried out for several days or weeks. One form of this disorder is the type variously known as Korsakoff\u2019s psychosis or, as it was called in DSM-IV, substance- induced persisting amnestic disorder. (DSM-5 has swept the entire former class of amnestic disorders into alcohol- induced major NCD, amnestic\u2013 confabulatory type.)

He had taught developmental biology for 30 522 C OGNITIVE DISORDERS years, but 6 months earlier the university had offered him early retirement. Soon after- wards, his daughter, Amarette, had moved in with him as housekeeper and companion. She provided most of the history of his illness. Amarette never understood how her father had managed to retain his position while drinking as much as he did. Of course, in later years his teaching assignments had always been lower- division, and he had published no research for over a decade. He was \u201cCOT,\u201d as the students put it\u2014\u201ccoasting on tenure.\u201d Tenure was a powerful influ- ence at the university; it forgave him the occasional missed class he was too hung over to attend, and the fact that he hardly ever graded a paper at all. By the time his daughter moved in, Mark was fully retired and devoting all of his time to drinking. Amarette quickly took care of that. She confiscated the contents of his bar and, by combining shame with threats, obtained such control over his finances that he was forced into total abstention. She remained steadfast through a week during which he vomited and had the shakes. At a stroke, she had rid her father of a 30-year habit. The results were both more and less than Amarette had expected. In the next 4 months Mark didn\u2019t touch a drop, but neither did he accomplish much of anything else. Even sober, he neglected his appearance, often going for days without shaving. He spent much of his time \u201cworking on a paper\u201d that was, as far as she could tell, recycled material from decades-old notebooks. He had simply copied it out unaltered. \u201cAnything there that made any sense at all, you could read in an old freshman biology text. A very old text,\u201d she said while he was being admitted. An event the day before had precipitated the admission. When she returned from a brief errand, she found him in the living room trying to mop up water from the bathtub that he had turned on and apparently forgotten about. The taps were still running.

    "a brief errand, she found him in the living room trying to mop up water from the bathtub that he had turned on and apparently forgotten about. The taps were still running. Mark was a pleasant enough man whose red nose and cheeks gave him a somewhat boyish appearance. He carried a sheaf of papers in a dog-eared manila folder; the title page read, \u201cLimb Regeneration in the Newt.\u201d His speech was normal, and he denied delusions, hallucinations, depression, and suicidal ideas. Although he seemed to pay attention during the MMSE, he scored only 19 out of 30. He was unable to recall two of three objects after 5 minutes. With difficulty, he correctly spelled world backward. When asked to follow the three-part instruction (to pick up a piece of paper, fold it, and place it on the floor), he persistently neglected to fold the paper. When asked about this, he brushed it off, saying, \u201cWell, I was thinking about my research.\u201d Evaluation of Mark Culpepper Central to many cases of NCD is memory impairment. In Mark\u2019s case, this was not apparent on casual observation. He was pleasant, carried on a conversation in a natural manner, and even appeared to be working on a scientific paper. However, after 5 min- utes he could recall only one of the three objects given to him on the MMSE. Mark gave no evidence of problems with language, attention, social cognition, or perceptual\u2013motor issues, but Amarette\u2019s history suggested that he\u2019d developed real Substance/Medication- Induced Neurocognitive Disorder 523 problems in caring for himself (neglecting his appearance, flooding the house with bathwater). This loss of executive functioning was reflected in bedside testing by his inability to follow a three-part instruction. It was enough to count as a major NCD (criterion A), though I\u2019d rate it as mild\u2014so far. Mark focused attention well, and it did not appear to wander during the interview, suggesting that a delirium was not responsible; persistence of his symptoms past the usual time course for withdrawal would fulfill this requirement (B). Heavy, prolonged alcohol use could certainly produce his symptoms (C), the course of which was consis- tent with the fact that they continued long after Amarette dragged him onto the wagon (D). Other mental pathology was not evident: Mark denied symptoms of depression and psychosis, which are the two major conditions that might present with neglect and memory loss. Of course,",
    "course of which was consis- tent with the fact that they continued long after Amarette dragged him onto the wagon (D). Other mental pathology was not evident: Mark denied symptoms of depression and psychosis, which are the two major conditions that might present with neglect and memory loss. Of course, a physical exam, and perhaps some testing, would be needed to rule out other medical illnesses (E). Considering his history, however, an alcohol- induced major NCD would seem highly probable. The matter of Mark\u2019s alcohol use disorder requires some thought. At the time he stopped drinking, when he developed shakiness and vomiting, we\u2019d have said he was in alcohol withdrawal. That, and the fact that alcohol had clearly interfered with both his work and his relationship with Amarette, would have been enough to diagnose alcohol use disorder. Unaddressed in the vignette are many of the remaining criteria for substance use disorder\u2014 craving for alcohol and tolerance, to name just two. A full exploration would probably yield enough symptoms to qualify him for the severest level of involvement. At any rate, we couldn\u2019t score it as mild, which would be misleading and inconsistent with alcohol withdrawal. OK, perhaps it\u2019s going a bit beyond the data, but it seems clinically appropriate to rate Mark\u2019s alcohol use disorder as severe; I\u2019ll select the appropriate codes from Table 15.2 in Chapter 15. Mark had recently retired and had time on his hands, which could be a problem\u2014 or an opportunity. (He might profit from occupational or recreational therapy, or even from referral to day care.) Either way, I\u2019d give him the appropriate Z-code. I can hardly believe that there would be nothing to report as regards his medical condition; we\u2019ll have to revisit it later. His GAF score would be 41. In the coding indicated just below, I\u2019ve indicated the numbers for both ICD-10 and ICD-9. However, I\u2019ve given only the terminology for the former (ICD-9 requires separate statements for the alcohol use disorder and NCD).

Before he left the Army a year before, he had been busted to buck private; this was the 524 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS culmination of a string of disciplinary actions for drunkenness. Fortunately, he had served 21 years and did not forfeit his retirement pay. For over a year, he had had monthly consultations with the current interviewer. On his last MMSE, Charles had scored 17: the full 9 points for language, 3 for spelling world backwards as drolw , 3 for registration (immediately repeating three items), and 2 for knowing the city and state. On this occasion, the interviewer asked when they had last met. Charles replied, \u201cWell, I just don\u2019t know. What do you think?\u201d To the follow-up question, he said that he guessed he had seen the interviewer before. \u201cMaybe it was last week.\u201d Asking him to remain seated, the interviewer went into the waiting room to ask Mrs. Jackson how she thought her husband was doing. She said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s about the same as before. He sketches some. He can still draw a pretty good caricature of you, as long as you\u2019re sitting right in front of him. But mostly he just sits around the house and watches TV. I come home and ask him what he\u2019s been watching, but he can\u2019t even tell me.\u201d At any rate, Charles was no longer drinking, not since they had moved to the coun- try. It was at least 2 miles to the nearest convenience store, and he didn\u2019t walk very well any more. \u201cBut he still talks about drinking. Sometimes he seems to think he\u2019s still in the Army. He orders me to go buy him a quart of gin.\u201d Charles remembered quite a few things, if they had happened long enough ago\u2014 the gin, for example, and getting drunk with his father when he was a boy. But he couldn\u2019t remember the name of his daughter, who was 2\u00bd years old. Most of the time, he just called her \u201cthe girl.\u201d The interviewer walked back into the inner office. Charles looked up and smiled. \u201cHave I seen you before?\u201d asked the interviewer. \u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d \u201cWhen was it?\u201d \u201cIt might have been last week.\u201d Evaluation of Charles Jackson Charles had not only an",

We hardly need objective testing to conclude that he\u2019d suf- fered a significant cognitive decline (major NCD criterion A). His wife testified that he just sat around; from that, I\u2019m going to extrapolate that he didn\u2019t do any of the bill- paying or household chores (B). We haven\u2019t determined, however, the extent to which he was able to provide self-care. Charles showed no evidence of shifting attention or reduced awareness, which would rule out a delirium (C). Given a little rope, Charles appeared to confabulate a previous meeting with the examiner. Although confabulation is not a criterion for diagnosis, it is one of the classic symptoms, to the extent that it even helps make up the named subtype. In alcohol- induced amnestic\u2013 confabulatory syndrome, memory is the principal disturbance. Substance/Medication- Induced Neurocognitive Disorder 525 However, problems with executive functioning (suggested by Charles\u2019s performance on the MMSE) can and do occur. The main items in the differential diagnosis would include other causes of major NCD and other complications of alcoholism. Either of these sources of confusion should be clear from the history. Of course, there was little danger that his condition would be mistaken for the memory blackouts associated with alcohol intoxication. Although elements of history are missing from the vignette, Charles should also receive a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Other than the ongoing desire to drink, he had not met the criteria during the past year, so he would earn the qualifier of in sustained remission . (I\u2019m almost tempted to add in a controlled environment , because where he lived, he couldn\u2019t get anywhere to obtain alcohol. Almost, but not quite.) His GAF score would be only 41. His diagnosis would come from Table 15.2: F10.26 [303.90, 291.1] Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission, with alcohol- induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic\u2013 confabulatory type, persistent Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies Whether it has one cause or many, the basic symptoms of NCD",
    "GAF score would be only 41. His diagnosis would come from Table 15.2: F10.26 [303.90, 291.1] Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission, with alcohol- induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic\u2013 confabulatory type, persistent Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies Whether it has one cause or many, the basic symptoms of NCD remain the same. Many medical and neurological disorders can be at fault, so the combinations are nearly end- less. Any patient\u2019s symptoms should be consistent with the underlying pathology, but it may be hard to discriminate the contributing factors on purely clinical grounds. Dementias with more than one cause are especially common in older people, who are prone to falls and multiple illnesses, and in persons whose drinking or drug use puts them at risk for a variety of medical disorders. For example, a patient with alcohol- induced major NCD may also have head trauma, infection, or a degenerative condition such as Marchiafava\u2013 Bignami disease (in which the corpus callosum of the brain is affected by chronic alcohol intake). The symptoms are much the same as with other causes of NCD, so I\u2019ve given no case example. In fact, I haven\u2019t even provided Essential Features; they seem pretty self- evident. Once you\u2019ve collected the symptoms and made the diagnosis, the only real remaining problem is this: How the heck do you code it? Basically, here\u2019s the plan (from Table 16.1b): First write down the names and codes for each of the contributing medical conditions. Then you add the appropriate code for major NCD {with}{without} behavioral disturbance. Below is the full diagnosis for a patient with long- established Huntington\u2019s disease who has also suffered a blow to the head. G10 [333.4] Huntington\u2019s disease S06.2X9S [907.0] Diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, sequela F02.81 [294.11] Major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral disturbance 526 COGNITIVE DISO rDErS Of course, there\u2019s a fly in the ointment. Three flies, in fact. Fly 1. If your patient has a vascular disorder that contributes to the NCD, you need to mention it separately. Suppose our unfortunate patient has Huntington\u2019s and a vascular NCD. Here\u2019s how the diagnosis would appear: G10 [333.4] Huntington\u2019s disease F02.80 [294.10] Major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, without behavioral disturbance F01.50 [290.40] Major vascular neurocognitive disorder {probably} {possibly} due to vascular disease, without behavioral disturbance Fly 2.

Suppose, after all that diagnosing, that your patient has \u201conly\u201d a mild NCD. Then you\u2019d list it this way: G31.84 [331.83] Mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies Note that you don\u2019t code the etiologies. However, you can add in the wording, \u201c{with}{without} behavioral disturbance.\u201d Fly 3. The DSM-5 criteria state that a diagnosis of probable major NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease requires that there be no evidence of mixed etiology, and spe- cifically mentions the example of vascular disease. However, NCD due to multiple etiologies specifically states the example of major NCD due to both Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular disease. If ever you face this irreconcilable contradiction, code as probable major NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and as major vascular NCD, but do not use the multiple- etiologies code. At least, that\u2019s what you should do until DSM-5 comes up with a better solution.

Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder 527 528 CHAPTEr 17 Personality Disorders Quick Guide to the Personality Disorders DSM-5 retains the 10 specific personality disorders (PDs) that were listed in DSM-IV. Of these, perhaps 6 have been studied reasonably well and have a lot of support in the research com- munity. The rest (paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, and dependent PDs), while perhaps less well founded in science, retain their positions in the diagnostic firmament because of their prac- tical use and, frankly, tradition. Speaking of tradition, ever since DSM-III in 1980 the personality disorders have been divided into three groups, called clusters. Heavily criticized for a lack of scientific validity, the clusters are perhaps most useful as a device to help us call to mind the full slate of PDs. Cluster A Personality Disorders People with Cluster A PDs can be described as withdrawn, cold, suspicious, or irrational. (Here and throughout the Quick Guide,",
    "for a lack of scientific validity, the clusters are perhaps most useful as a device to help us call to mind the full slate of PDs. Cluster A Personality Disorders People with Cluster A PDs can be described as withdrawn, cold, suspicious, or irrational. (Here and throughout the Quick Guide, as usual, the page number following each item indi- cates where a more detailed discussion begins.) Paranoid. These people are suspicious and quick to take offense. They often have few confi- dants and may read hidden meaning into innocent remarks (p. 533). Schizoid. These patients care little for social relationships, have a restricted emotional range, and seem indifferent to criticism or praise. Tending to be solitary, they avoid close (including sexual) relationships (p. 535). Schizotypal. Interpersonal relationships are so difficult for these people that they appear peculiar or strange to others. They lack close friends and are uncomfortable in social situa- tions. They may show suspiciousness, unusual perceptions or thinking, eccentric speech, and inappropriate affect (p. 538). Cluster B Personality Disorders Those with Cluster B PDs tend to be rather theatrical, emotional, and attention- seeking; their moods are labile and often shallow. They often have intense interpersonal conflicts. Antisocial. The irresponsible, often criminal behavior of these people begins in childhood or early adolescence with truancy, running away, cruelty, fighting, destructiveness, lying, and theft. In addition to criminal behavior, as adults they may default on debts or otherwise behave irresponsibly; act recklessly or impulsively; and show no remorse for their behavior (p. 541). Borderline. These impulsive people engage in behavior harmful to themselves (sexual adventures, unwise spending, excessive use of substances or food). Affectively unstable, they often show intense, inappropriate anger. They feel empty or bored, and they frantically try to avoid abandonment. They are uncertain about who they are, and they lack the ability to maintain stable interpersonal relationships (p. 545). Histrionic. Overly emotional, vague, and desperate for attention, these people need con - stant reassurance about their attractiveness. They may be self- centered and sexually seduc- tive (p. 548). Narcissistic. These people are self- important and often preoccupied with envy, fantasies of success, or ruminations about the uniqueness of their own problems. Their sense of entitle- ment and lack of compassion may cause them to take advantage of others. They vigorously reject criticism and need constant attention and admiration (p. 550).

They vigorously reject criticism and need constant attention and admiration (p. 550). Cluster C Personality Disorders Someone with a Cluster C PD will tend to be anxious and tense, often overcontrolled. Avoidant. These timid people are so easily wounded by criticism that they hesitate to become involved with others. They may fear the embarrassment of showing emotion or of saying things that seem foolish. They may have no close friends, and they exaggerate the risks of undertaking pursuits outside their usual routines (p. 553). Dependent. These people so much need the approval of others that they have trouble mak- ing independent decisions or starting projects; they may even agree with others whom they know to be wrong. They fear abandonment, feel helpless when they are alone, and are miserable when relationships end. They are easily hurt by criticism and will even volunteer for unpleasant tasks to gain the favor of others (p. 556). Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive. Perfectionism and rigidity characterize these people. They are often workaholics, and they tend to be indecisive, excessively scrupulous, and preoccupied with detail They insist that others do things their way. They have trouble expressing affection, Quick Guide to the Personality Disorders 529 tend to lack generosity, and may even resist throwing away worthless objects they no longer need (p. 558). Other Causes of Long- Standing Character Disturbance Personality change due to another medical condition. A medical condition can affect a patient\u2019s personality for the worse. This would not qualify as a PD, because it may be less pervasive and not present from an early age (p. 560). Other mental disorders. When they persist for a long time (usually years), a variety of other mental conditions can distort the way a person behaves and relates to others. This can give the appearance of a personality disorder. Especially good examples include dysthy- mia, schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder, and cognitive disorders. Some studies find that patients with mood disorders are more likely to show personality traits or PDs when they are clinically depressed; this may be especially true of Cluster A and Cluster C traits.

Personal- ity pathology noted in depressed patients should be reevaluated once the depression has remitted. Other specified, or unspecified, personality disorder. Use one of these categories for per - sonality disturbances that do not meet the criteria for any of the disorders above, or for PDs that have not achieved official status (p. 563). Introduction All humans (and numerous other species as well) have personality traits. These are well- ingrained ways in which individuals experience, interact with, and think about everything that goes on around them. PDs are collections of traits that have become rigid and work to individuals\u2019 disadvantage, to the point that they impair functioning or cause distress. These patterns of behavior and thinking have been present since early adult life and have been recognizable in the patient for a long time. Personality, and therefore PDs, should probably be thought of as dimensional rather than categorical; this means that their components (traits) are present in normal people, but are accentuated in those with the disorders in question. But for good rea - sons and bad, DSM-5 has retained the traditional categorical structure that has been used for more than 30 years. There are promises that this will change in the coming years; indeed, DSM-5 devotes a long portion of its Section III (material not officially approved for use) to exploring alternative diagnostic structures. However, the experts will first have to agree as to which dimensions to use, then how best to measure and cat- egorize them, and then how to interpret the results. In the meantime, we will continue to muddle along pretty much as before. 530 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS As currently defined in DSM-5, all PDs have in common the following character - istics. Essential Features of a General Personality Disorder There is a lasting pattern of behavior and internal experience (thoughts, feelings, sensations) that is clearly different from the patient\u2019s culture. This pattern includes problems with affect (type, intensity, lability, appropriateness); cognition (how the patient sees and interprets self and the environment); control of impulses; and inter- personal relationships. This pattern is fixed and applies broadly across the patient\u2019s social and personal life.

    "lability, appropriateness); cognition (how the patient sees and interprets self and the environment); control of impulses; and inter- personal relationships. This pattern is fixed and applies broadly across the patient\u2019s social and personal life. The Fine Print The D\u2019s: \u2022 Duration (lifelong, with roots in adolescence or childhood) \u2022 Diffuse con- texts \u2022 Distress and disability (work/educational, social, and personal) \u2022 Differential diagnosis (substance use, physical illness, other mental disorders, other PDs, person- ality change due to another medical condition) The information PDs convey gives the clinician a better understanding of the behavior of patients; it can also augment our understanding of the management of many patients. As you read these descriptions and the accompanying vignettes, keep in mind the twin hallmarks of the PDs: early onset (usually by late teens) and pervasive nature, such that a disorder\u2019s features affect multiple aspects of work, personal, and social life. Diagnosing Personality Disorders The diagnosis of PDs presents a variety of problems. On the one hand, they are often overlooked; on the other, however, they are sometimes overdiagnosed (borderline PD is, in my opinion, a notorious example). One (antisocial PD) carries a terrible prognosis; most, if not all, are hard to treat. Their relatively weak validity suggests that no PD should be the sole diagnosis when another mental disorder can explain the signs and symptoms that make up the clinical picture. For all of these reasons, it is a good idea to have in mind an outline for making the diagnosis of a PD. 1. Verify the duration of the symptoms. Make sure that your patient\u2019s symptoms have been present at least since early adulthood (before age 15 for antisocial PD). Interviewing informants (family, friends, coworkers) will probably give you the most valid material. 2. Verify that the symptoms affect several areas of the patient\u2019s life. Specifically, Introduction 531 are work (or school), home life, personal life, and social life affected? This step can present real problems, in that patients themselves often don\u2019t see their behavior as causing problems. (\u201cIt\u2019s the world that\u2019s out of step.\u201d) 3. Check that the patient fully qualifies for the particular diagnosis in question. This means checking all the characteristics and consulting all 10 sets of diag - nostic criteria. Sometimes you have to make a judgment call. Try to be as objec- tive as possible. As with other mental disorders, with enough motivation you can usually",
    "qualifies for the particular diagnosis in question. This means checking all the characteristics and consulting all 10 sets of diag - nostic criteria. Sometimes you have to make a judgment call. Try to be as objec- tive as possible. As with other mental disorders, with enough motivation you can usually force a patient into a variety of diagnoses. 4. If the patient is under age 18, make sure that the symptoms have been present for at least the past 12 months. (And be really, really sure that they aren\u2019t due instead to some other mental or physical disorder.) I personally prefer not mak- ing such a diagnosis at such a tender age. 5. Rule out other mental pathology that may be more acute and have greater potential for doing harm. The flip side is that other mental disorders are also often more responsive to treatment than are PDs. 6. This is also a good time to review the generic features for any other require - ments you may have missed. Note that each patient must have two or more types of lasting problems with behavior, thoughts, or emotions from a list of four: cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and impulsive. (This helps ensure that the patient\u2019s problems truly do affect more than one life area.) 7. Search for other PDs. Evaluate the entire history to learn whether any addi - tional PD is present. Many patients appear to have more than one PD; in such cases, diagnose them all. Perhaps more often, you will find too few symptoms to make any diagnosis. Then you can add to your summary note something to the effect: schizoid and paranoid personality traits. 8. Record all personality and nonpersonality mental diagnoses. Some examples of how this is done are shown in the vignettes that follow. Although you can learn the rudiments of each PD from the material I present here, it is important to note that these abbreviated descriptions only begin to tap their rich psychopathology. If you want to make a study of these disorders, I strongly recommend that you consult standard texts.

    "Personality Disorders The PDs included in Cluster A share behaviors generally described as withdrawn, cold, suspicious, or irrational. 532 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS F60.0 [301.0] Paranoid Personality Disorder What you notice most about patients with paranoid PD (PPD) is how little they trust\u2014 and how much they suspect\u2014other people. The suspicions they harbor are unjustified, but because they fear exploitation, they will not confide in those whose behavior should have earned their trust. Instead, they read unintended meaning into benign comments and actions, and they will interpret untoward occurrences as the result of deliberate intent. They tend to harbor resentment for a long time, perhaps forever. These people tend to be rigid and litigious, and may have an especially urgent need to be self- sufficient. To others, they can appear to be cold, calculating, guarded people who avoid both blame and intimacy. They may appear tense and have trouble relaxing during an interview. This disorder is especially likely to create occupational difficulties: Patients with PPD are so aware of rank and power that they frequently have trouble dealing with superiors and coworkers. Although it is apparently far from rare (it may affect 1% of the general population), PPD rarely comes to clinical attention. When it does, it is usually diagnosed in men. Its relationship (if any) to the development of schizophrenia remains unclear, but if you find that it has preceded the onset of schizophrenia, add the specifier (premorbid). Essential Features of Paranoid Personality Disorder In many situations, these patients demonstrate that they distrust the loyalty or trust- worthiness of others. Because they suspect that other people want to deceive, hurt, or exploit them, they hesitate to share personal information. Unjustified suspicions about the faithfulness of spouse or partner, or even the (mis)perception of hidden content in everyday events or speech, can lead to the bearing of grudges or to rapid response with anger or attacks in kind.

Dr. Schatzky A professor of dermatology at University Hospital, Dr. Schatzky had never consulted a mental health professional. But he was well known to the staff at the medical center Paranoid Personality Disorder 533 and notorious among his colleagues. One of them, Dr. Cohen, provided most of the information for this vignette. Dr. Schatzky had been around for several years. He was known as a solid researcher and an excellent clinician. A hard worker, he supervised fellows working on two grants and carried more than his share of the teaching load. One of the trainees working in his lab was a physician named Masters. He was a bright, capable young man whose career in academic dermatology seemed destined to soar. When Dr. Masters got an offer from Boston of an assistant professorship and his own lab space, he told Dr. Schatzky that he was sorry, but he would leave at the end of the semester. Furthermore, he wanted to use some of their data. Dr. Schatzky was more than upset. He responded by telling Dr. Masters that \u201cwhat happened in the lab stayed in the lab.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to \u201crip him off,\u201d and he told Dr. Masters that he would be blackballed if he tried to publish papers based on their findings. Furthermore, Dr. Schatzky told him to keep away from the students until he left. This outraged the other dermatologists. Dr. Masters was one of the most popular young teachers in the department, and the notion that he shouldn\u2019t have any contact with the students seemed punitive to all and little short of an assault on academic freedom. The other dermatologists discussed the situation in a department meeting when Dr. Schatzky was out of town. One of the older professors had volunteered to try to persuade him to let Dr. Masters teach anyway. Subsequently, Dr. Schatzky refused with the response, \u201cWhat have I done to you?\u201d He now seemed to think that the other professor had it in for him. This professor told Dr. Cohen that he wasn\u2019t really surprised. He\u2019d known Dr. Schatzky since college, and he\u2019d always been a suspicious type. \u201cHe won\u2019t confide in anyone without a signed loyalty oath,\u201d was how the other professor put it.

Dr. Schatzky seemed to think that if he said anything nice, it would somehow be turned against him. The only person he seemed to trust completely was his wife, a rabbity little creature who had probably never disagreed with him in her life. At the meeting, someone else suggested that the department chairman should talk to him and try to \u201cjolly him along a bit.\u201d But Dr. Schatzky had little sense of humor and \u201cthe longest memory for a grudge of anyone on the face of the planet.\u201d In the collective memory of all the staff, Dr. Schatzky had never had mood swings or psychosis, and at department dinners, he didn\u2019t drink. \u201cNever out of touch with real- ity, only nasty,\u201d said Dr. Cohen. Evaluation of Dr. Schatzky I begin with a disclaimer: From the information available in this vignette, it would appear that Dr. Schatzky had never been interviewed by a mental health professional. Any conclusions must therefore be tentative. Clinicians simply have no right to make definitive diagnoses of patients\u2014or just plain people\u2014for whom they haven\u2019t gathered adequate information. That said, Dr. Schatzky\u2019s symptoms had apparently been quite constant and pres- 534 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS ent throughout his entire adult life (at least since college). His problems involved both his thinking and his interpersonal functioning, which in turn led to problems with his work and personal life. What symptoms of PPD did Dr. Schatzky have? Without cause, he suspected young Dr. Masters of planning to \u201crip off\u2019 his data (criterion A1). His colleagues noted his long- standing concerns about the loyalty of associates (A2). He would never confide in others (A3), and he refused to let Dr. Masters teach, which sounds a lot like holding a grudge (A5). (However, he had apparently never questioned the loyalty of his wife, which would be another common symptom of this PD.) So we can find a total of four symptoms, which is what\u2019s required for a diagnosis of PPD. Could a non-PD diagnosis explain Dr. Schatzky\u2019s behavior as described? Although the information is incomplete, drug or alcohol use appears unlikely. (It also seems unlikely that anyone of middle age",
    "this PD.) So we can find a total of four symptoms, which is what\u2019s required for a diagnosis of PPD. Could a non-PD diagnosis explain Dr. Schatzky\u2019s behavior as described? Although the information is incomplete, drug or alcohol use appears unlikely. (It also seems unlikely that anyone of middle age could have been taking a medication long enough to produce character disturbance that had lasted his entire adult life.) The vignette provides no evidence of another medical condition . According to the information provided, Dr. Schatzky had never had frank psychosis, such as delusional disorder or schizophrenia, and he had no mood disorder (B). What about other PDs? Patients with schizoid PD are cold and aloof, and as a result may appear distrustful, but they do not have the prominent suspiciousness char- acteristic of patients with PPD. Patients with schizotypal PD may have paranoid ide- ation, but they also appear peculiar or odd (not the case here). And Dr. Schatzky didn\u2019t appear to prefer solitude. Those with antisocial PD are often cold and unfeeling, may be suspicious, and have trouble forming interpersonal relationships. However, they rarely have the perseverance to complete professional school, and Dr. Schatzky had no history of criminal behavior or reckless disregard for the safety of others. With a GAF score of 70, Dr. Schatzky\u2019s tentative diagnosis would be as follows: F60.0 [301.0] Paranoid personality disorder F60.1 [301.20] Schizoid Personality Disorder People with schizoid personality disorder (SzPD) are indifferent to the society of other people, sometimes profoundly so. Typically, they are lifelong loners who show a restricted emotional range; they appear unsociable, cold, and reclusive. Patients with SzPD may succeed at solitary jobs that others find difficult to toler - ate. They may daydream excessively, become attached to animals, and often do not marry or even form long- lasting romantic relationships. They do retain contact with reality, unless they develop schizophrenia. However, their relatives are not at increased risk for that disease. Although it is uncommonly diagnosed, SzPD is relatively common, affecting per - haps a few percent of the general population. Men may be at greater risk than women. The following patient was the younger brother of Lyonel Childs, whose history has been presented in connection with schizophrenia (p. 67).

Schizoid Personality Disorder 535 Essential Features of Schizoid Personality Disorder In many situations, these patients remain isolated and have a narrow emotional range. Preferring solitude in their activities, they neither want nor enjoy close rela - tionships, including those with family. They may have no close friends, with the possi- ble exception of relatives. Indeed, they enjoy few activities, even showing little inter- est in sex with other people. Emotionally cold or detached, they seem indifferent to both criticism and praise.

Lester Childs \u201cWe brought him in because of what happened to Lyonel. They seemed so much alike, and we were worried.\u201d Lester\u2019s mother sat primly on the office sofa. \u201cAfter Lyonel was arrested, that\u2019s when we decided.\u201d At 20, Lester Childs was in many ways a carbon copy of his older brother. Born several weeks prematurely, he had spent his first few weeks of life in an incubator. But he gained weight rapidly and was soon well within the norms for his age. He walked, talked, and was toilet- trained at the usual ages. Perhaps because they both worked so hard on the farm, or perhaps because there were no other young chil - dren for Lester and his siblings to play with, his parents noticed nothing wrong until Lester entered first grade. Within a few weeks, his teacher had telephoned to set up a conference. Lester seemed bright enough, they were told; his schoolwork wasn\u2019t in question. But his sociability was next to nil. At recess, when the other children played dodge ball or pom-pom- pullaway, he remained in the classroom to color. He seldom participated in group discussions, and he always sat a few inches back from the others in the reading circle. When his turn for show and tell came, he stood silently in front of the class for a few moments, then pulled a length of kite string from his pocket and dropped it onto the floor. Then",
    "always sat a few inches back from the others in the reading circle. When his turn for show and tell came, he stood silently in front of the class for a few moments, then pulled a length of kite string from his pocket and dropped it onto the floor. Then he sat down. Most of this behavior was quite a lot like Lyonel\u2019s, so the parents hadn\u2019t been too worried. Even so, they took him to see their family doctor, who agreed that it was prob- ably normal for their family and that he would \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d But Lester never did; he only grew up. He never even participated in family activities. At Christmas, he would 536 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS open a present, take it over to a corner, and play with it by himself. Even Lyonel never did that. When Lester entered the room, it was clear that he didn\u2019t regard the appointment as much of an occasion. He wore jeans with one knee missing, tattered sneakers, and a T-shirt that at one time surely had had sleeves. Through much of the interview, he continued to leaf through a magazine devoted to astronomy and math. After waiting more than a minute for Lester to say something, the interviewer began. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m OK.\u201d Lester kept on reading. \u201cYour mom and dad asked you to come in to see me today. Can you tell me why?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d \u201cDo you have any ideas about it?\u201d [Silence.] Most of the interview went that way. Lester willingly gave information when he was directly asked, but he seemed completely uninterested in volunteering anything. Sitting quietly, nose in his magazine, he showed no other abnormalities or eccentrici - ties of behavior. His flow of speech (what there was of it) was logical and sequential. He was fully oriented, and he scored a perfect 30 on the MMSE. His mood was \u201cOK\u201d\u2014nei- ther too happy nor too sad. He had never used alcohol or drugs of any kind. He calmly but emphatically denied ever hearing voices, seeing visions, or having beliefs that he was being watched, followed, talked about, or otherwise interfered with. \u201cI\u2019m not like my brother,\u201d he said in his longest spontaneous speech up to that point. When asked who he was like, Lester said it was Greta Garbo\u2014who famously wanted to be left alone. He claimed he didn\u2019t",
    "that he was being watched, followed, talked about, or otherwise interfered with. \u201cI\u2019m not like my brother,\u201d he said in his longest spontaneous speech up to that point. When asked who he was like, Lester said it was Greta Garbo\u2014who famously wanted to be left alone. He claimed he didn\u2019t need friends, and he could also do without his family. Neither did he need sex. He had checked out the sex magazines and anatomy books. Females and males were equally boring. His idea of a good way to spend his life was to live alone on an island, like Robinson Crusoe. \u201cBut no Friday.\u201d Tucking his magazine under his arm, Lester left the office, never to return. Evaluation of Lester Childs Any diagnosis of a PD requires that the difficulties be both pervasive and enduring. Although he was only 20 years old, Lester\u2019s problems had certainly been enduring: They were noticeable when he was 6. And as far as we can tell, his rejection of interper- sonal contact extended into every facet of his life\u2014family, social, and school. Lester rejected close relationships, even with his family (criterion A1); he preferred solitary activities (A2); he rejected the notion of having a sexual relationship with any - one (although this could conceivably change with maturity and opportunity\u2014A3); he had always lacked close friends (A5); his affect seemed quite flat and detached (although this could have been an artifact of a first interview with a reluctant interviewee\u2014A7). In any event, Lester met at least four and possibly five diagnostic criteria (four are required) for SzPD. These symptoms would satisfy three of the areas (cognition, affect, and interpersonal functioning) mentioned in the generic criteria for a PD. His interest Schizoid Personality Disorder 537 in mathematics and astronomy would not be unusual in persons with this disorder, who typically thrive on work that others might find too lonely to enjoy. Could any other disorder better explain Lester\u2019s clinical picture? Patients with depressive disorders are often withdrawn and unsociable, but these seldom persist life- long. Besides, Lester specifically denied feeling depressed or lonely; any doubts on the point could be settled by asking about vegetative symptoms of depression (changes in appetite or sleep). He also denied having symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) that would suggest schizophrenia, and this was supported by collateral information from his mother. There were no stereotypies or symptoms of impaired communication, as we\u2019d",
    "the point could be settled by asking about vegetative symptoms of depression (changes in appetite or sleep). He also denied having symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) that would suggest schizophrenia, and this was supported by collateral information from his mother. There were no stereotypies or symptoms of impaired communication, as we\u2019d expect for autism spectrum disorder, or disturbance of consciousness of memory, as would be required for a cognitive disorder. From the information we have, he was physically healthy and did not use drugs, alcohol, or medications (B). What other PDs should we consider? Patients with schizotypal PD can have con- stricted affect and unusual appearance. Lester\u2019s clothing was out of keeping for most visits to a professional office but would probably be quite usual for someone 20 years old, and he denied having any beliefs that might seem odd. He did not voice any ideas of deep suspicion or distrust, such as might be encountered in paranoid PD . Patients with avoidant PD are also isolated from other people; unlike patients with SzPD, how- ever, they don\u2019t choose this isolation, and they suffer for it. If Lester later developed schizophrenia, the qualifier (premorbid) would be added at that time to his diagnosis. I find it difficult to place him squarely on the GAF Scale. The score of 65 is to some extent a matter of taste, and arguable. F60.1 [301.20] Schizoid personality disorder F21 [301.22] Schizotypal Personality Disorder From an early age, patients with schizotypal personality disorder (StPD) have lasting interpersonal deficiencies that severely reduce their capacity for closeness with oth - ers. They also have distorted or eccentric thinking, perceptions, and behaviors, which can make them seem odd. They often feel anxious when with strangers, and they have almost no close friends. They may be suspicious and superstitious; their peculiarities of thought include magical thinking and belief in telepathy or other unusual modes of communication. Such patients may talk about sensing a \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cpresence,\u201d or have speech characterized by vagueness, digressions, excessive abstractions, impoverished vocabulary, or unusual use of words. Patients with StPD may eventually develop schizophrenia. Many of them are depressed when they first come to clinical attention. Their eccentric ideas and style of thinking also place them at risk for becoming involved with cults. They get along poorly with others, and under stress they may become briefly psychotic. Despite their odd behavior, many marry and work.",

This disorder occurs about as often as schizoid PD. 538 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS Essential Features of Schizotypal Personality Disorder In many situations, these patients tend to be isolated and exhibit a narrow emo - tional range with other people. They will have paranoid or suspicious ideas, even ideas of reference (which, however, are not held to a delusional extent). Their dress or mannerisms may give them an odd appearance, with affect that is inappropri - ate or constricted; speech can be vague, impoverished, or overly abstract. They may report strange perceptions or physical sensations, and their peculiar behavior may be affected by magical thinking or other odd beliefs (superstitions, a belief in telepa - thy). With severe social anxiety (which doesn\u2019t improve with acquaintance), they tend to have no intimate friends.

Timothy Oldham \u201cBut it\u2019s my baby! I don\u2019t care what he had to do with it!\u201d Hugely pregnant and miser- able, Charlotte Grenville sat in the interviewer\u2019s office and wept with frustration. She was there at the request of the presiding judge in a battle over visitation rights with her yet- unborn child. The identity of the father was never in doubt. The week after her second missed period, Charlotte had visited a gynecologist and then called Timothy Oldham with the news. She had considered threatening to sue him for child support, but that hadn\u2019t been necessary. He made good money installing carpets and had no dependents. He offered her a generous monthly stipend, beginning immediately. But he wanted to help rear their child. Charlotte had rejected that idea out of hand and then filed suit. With a crowded court docket, the case had dragged on nearly as long as Charlotte\u2019s pregnancy. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s really weird!\u201d \u201cWhat do you",

He had a sister who died; he talks about her like she\u2019s still alive. And he does weird things. Like, when we were making love, right in the middle he started this babble about \u2018holy love\u2019 and dedicating his seed. It put me right off. I told him to stop and get off, but it was too late. I mean, would you want your kid growing up with that for a father?\u201d Schizotypal Personality Disorder 539 \u201cIf he\u2019s so peculiar, how did you get involved with him?\u201d She looked abashed. \u201cWell, we only did it once. And I might have been a little bit drunk at the time.\u201d Timothy was not only sedate, but nearly immobile. He sat quietly in the interview chair, a gangly blond whose hair swept across his forehead nearly to his eye brows. He told his story in a dull monotone that didn\u2019t reveal the slightest trace of emotion. Timothy Oldham and his twin sister, Miranda, had been orphaned when they were 4 years old. He had no memory of his parents, other than a vague impression that they might have made their living from a marijuana farm in northern California. The two children had been taken in by an aunt and uncle\u2014 Southern Baptists who, he said, made the farm couple in Grant Woods\u2019s American Gothic look cheerful by comparison. \u201cThat painting, it\u2019s really them. I have a copy of it in my bedroom. Sometimes I can almost see my uncle moving the pitchfork back and forth to signal me.\u201d \u201cIs it really your uncle, and does the pitchfork really move?\u201d the interviewer wanted to know. \u201cWell, it\u2019s more of a feeling I get . . . not really . . . a sign of my Christian endeavor . . . \u201d Timothy\u2019s voice trailed off, but he kept gazing straight ahead.

    "really . . . a sign of my Christian endeavor . . . \u201d Timothy\u2019s voice trailed off, but he kept gazing straight ahead. The \u201cChristian endeavor,\u201d he explained, meant that everyone was put on earth for some special purpose. His uncle always used to say that. He thought his own purpose might be to help raise the baby growing inside Charlotte. He knew there had to be more to life than laying carpets all day. Timothy had only a few friends, none of them close. He and Charlotte had spent no more than a few hours together. In response to a question, he talked about his sister. Miranda and he had been understandably close; she was the only real friend he had ever had. She died of a brain tumor when they were 16, and Timothy was devastated. \u201cWe were webbed together when we were born. I swore at her graveside it would never be undone.\u201d With still no inflection in his voice, Timothy explained that being \u201cwebbed together\u201d was something you were born with. He and Miranda still were webbed. It was a Christian endeavor, and she was directing him from beyond the grave to have a baby girl. He said that it would be having Miranda back again. He knew that the baby wouldn\u2019t actually be Miranda, but said he knew it would be a girl. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those feelings. But I know I\u2019m right.\u201d Timothy responded in the negative to the usual questions about hallucinations, delu- sions, abnormal moods, substance use, and medical problems such as head injury and seizure disorders. Then he arose from his seat and left the room without another word. That evening Charlotte Grenville gave birth\u2014to a healthy boy. Evaluation of Timothy Oldham Charlotte\u2019s testimony suggested that Timothy\u2019s peculiarities had been present for years. Although we don\u2019t know much about his school career or work, his symptoms would seem likely to affect most areas of his life. This point should be more fully explored. 540 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS Timothy\u2019s schizotypal symptoms included odd beliefs (his conviction that the baby would be his sister returned to earth; there is no evidence that he came from a sub - culture where this sort of thinking was the norm\u2014 criterion A2), illusions (the farmer in the picture waving his pitchfork\u2014A3), constricted affect (A6), and absence of close friends (A8).

His words (\u201cwebbed together,\u201d \u201cChristian endeavor\u201d) seemed metaphori- cal and odd (A4). Unexplored by the interviewer were the presence of ideas of refer - ence, paranoid ideas, odd behavior, and excessive social anxiety. Cognitive, affective, and interpersonal symptoms were represented here, however (see the Essential Fea - tures for a general PD). This evaluation turned up no indications of another mental disorder. Timothy specifically denied the actual psychotic symptoms necessary to support a diagnosis of delusional disorder or schizophrenia. Other conditions that could entail psychotic symptoms include mood disorders and cognitive disorders , but we\u2019ve seen evidence against both (B). Other PDs to consider would include schizoid and paranoid PDs. Each of these implies some degree of social isolation, but not the eccentric thinking of StPD. Patients with any of these three Cluster A disorders can decompensate into brief psychoses\u2014a trait held in common with borderline PD. Some patients may qualify for two diagnoses simultaneously: borderline PD and one of the Cluster A PDs. Patients with avoidant PD are socially isolated, but they suffer from it and lack odd behavior and thinking. Of course, a personality change due to another medical condition must be considered in those who have a severe or chronic illness; Timothy didn\u2019t. As of this evaluation, Tim would receive a GAF score of 75. He hadn\u2019t developed schizophrenia, so we wouldn\u2019t use the qualifier (premorbid). F21 [301.22] Schizotypal personality disorder Z65.3 [V62.5] Litigation regarding child visitation Cluster B Personality Disorders People with Cluster B PDs tend to be dramatic, emotional, and attention- seeking, with moods that are labile and often shallow. They often have intense interpersonal conflicts. F60.2 [301.7] Antisocial Personality Disorder Those with antisocial PD (ASPD) chronically disregard and violate the rights of other people; they cannot or will not conform to the norms of society. This said, there are a number of ways in which people can exhibit ASPD. Some are engaging con artists; others are, frankly, graceless thugs. Women (and some men) with the disorder may be involved in prostitution. In still other individuals, the more traditional antisocial aspects may be obscured by the heavy use (and",
    "are a number of ways in which people can exhibit ASPD. Some are engaging con artists; others are, frankly, graceless thugs. Women (and some men) with the disorder may be involved in prostitution. In still other individuals, the more traditional antisocial aspects may be obscured by the heavy use (and often purveyance) of illicit drugs. Although some of these people seem superficially charming, many are aggressive Antisocial Personality Disorder 541 and irritable. Their irresponsible behavior affects nearly every life area. Besides sub - stance use, there may be fighting, lying, and criminal behavior of every conceivable sort: theft, violence, confidence schemes, and child and spouse abuse. They may claim to have guilt feelings, but they don\u2019t appear to feel genuine remorse for their behavior. Although they may complain of multiple somatic problems and will occasionally make suicide attempts, their manipulative interactions with others make it difficult to deter- mine whether their complaints are genuine. DSM-5 criteria for ASPD specify that, beginning before age 15, the patient must have a history that would support a diagnosis of conduct disorder (p. 381); as an adult, this behavior must have continued and been extended, with at least four ASPD symp - toms. As many as 3% of men, but only about 1% of women, have this disorder; it is found in about three- quarters of penitentiary prisoners. It is more common among lower- socioeconomic- status populations and runs in families; it probably has both a genetic and an environmental basis. Male relatives have ASPD and substance- related disor- ders; female relatives have somatic symptom disorder and substance- related disorders. Childhood attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a common precursor, and child - hood conduct disorder is a requirement (see above). Although treatment seems to make little difference to patients with ASPD, there is some evidence that the disorder decreases with advancing age, as these people mellow out to become \u201conly\u201d substance users. Death by suicide or homicide is the lot of others. Generally, the diagnosis of ASPD will not be warranted if antisocial behavior occurs only in the context of substance abuse. Individuals who misuse substances some- times engage in criminal behavior, but only when in pursuit of drugs. It is crucial to learn whether patients with possible ASPD have engaged in illicit acts when not using substances. Although these patients often have a childhood marked by incorrigibility, delin - quency, and school problems such",
    "substances some- times engage in criminal behavior, but only when in pursuit of drugs. It is crucial to learn whether patients with possible ASPD have engaged in illicit acts when not using substances. Although these patients often have a childhood marked by incorrigibility, delin - quency, and school problems such as truancy, fewer than half the children with such a background eventually develop the full adult syndrome. Therefore, we should never make this diagnosis before age 18. Finally, ASPD is a serious disorder, with no known effective treatment. It is there- fore a diagnosis of last resort. Before making it, redouble efforts to rule out other major mental disorders and PDs. Essential Features of Antisocial Personality Disorder These patients have a history dating to before age 15 of destroying property, serious rule violation, or aggression against people or animals (that is, they fulfill criteria for conduct disorder, p. 381). Since then, in many situations, they lie, con, or give an alias while engaging in behaviors that merit arrest (whether or not they are actually detained). They tend to fight or assault others, and generally fail to plan their activi- ties, relying instead on the inspiration of the impulse. For none of this behavior do 542 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS they show remorse, other than feeling sorry if caught. They will refuse to pay their debts or maintain steady employment. They may irresponsibly place themselves or other people in danger.

Since then, he had had at least 15 different jobs; the longest of them had lasted 6 months. Milo was referred for evaluation after he was caught trying to con money from elderly patrons at an ATM. The machine was one of two that served the branch bank where his mother worked as assistant manager. \u201cThe little devil!\u201d his father exclaimed during the initial interview. \u201cHe was always a difficult one to raise, even when he was a kid.

The machine was one of two that served the branch bank where his mother worked as assistant manager. \u201cThe little devil!\u201d his father exclaimed during the initial interview. \u201cHe was always a difficult one to raise, even when he was a kid. Kinda reminded me of me, sometimes. Only I pulled out of it.\u201d Milo had picked a lot of fights when he was a boy. He had bloodied his first nose when he was only 5, and the world-class spanking administered by his father had taught him nothing about keeping his fists to himself. Later he was suspended from the sev - enth grade for extorting $3 and change from an 8-year-old. When the suspension was finally lifted, he responded by ditching class for 47 straight days. Then began a string of encounters with the police, beginning with shoplifting (condoms) and progressing through breaking and entering (four counts) to grand theft auto when he was 15. For stealing the Toyota, he was sent for half a year to a camp run by the state youth author- ity. \u201cIt was the only 6 months his mother and I ever knew where he was at night,\u201d his father observed. Milo\u2019s time in detention seemed to have done him some good, at least initially. Although he never returned to school, for the next 2 years he avoided arrest and inter- mittently applied himself to learning his trade. Then he celebrated his 19th birthday by getting drunk and joining the Army. Within a few months he was out on the street again, with a bad- conduct discharge for sharing cocaine in his barracks and assaulting two corporals, his first sergeant, and a second lieutenant. For the next several years, he worked when he needed cash and couldn\u2019t get it any other way. Not long before this evaluation, he had gotten a 16-year-old girl pregnant. \u201cShe was just a ditsy broad.\u201d Milo lounged back, one leg over the arm of the inter- view chair. He had managed to grow a scraggly beard, and he rolled a toothpick around Antisocial Personality Disorder 543 in the corner of his mouth. The letters H-A-T-E and L-O-V-E were clumsily tattooed across the knuckles of either hand. \u201cShe didn\u2019t object when she was gettin\u2019 laid.\u201d Milo\u2019s mood was good now, and he had never had anything that resembled mania.

    "Antisocial Personality Disorder 543 in the corner of his mouth. The letters H-A-T-E and L-O-V-E were clumsily tattooed across the knuckles of either hand. \u201cShe didn\u2019t object when she was gettin\u2019 laid.\u201d Milo\u2019s mood was good now, and he had never had anything that resembled mania. There had never been symptoms of psychosis, except for the time he was coming off speed. He \u201cfelt a little paranoid\u201d then, but it didn\u2019t last. The ATM job was a scam thought up by a friend. The friend had read something like it in the newspaper and decided it would be a good way to obtain fast cash. They had never thought they might be caught, and Milo hadn\u2019t considered the effect it would have on his mother. He yawned and said, \u201cShe can always get another job.\u201d Evaluation of Milo Tark Milo\u2019s behavior persistently affected all aspects of his life: school, work, family, and interpersonal relations. By the time he was 15, he easily met criteria for conduct disor- der (ASPD criterion C). Afterwards, he moved on to full-blown adult criminality that persisted through his early 20s: repeated illegal acts (A1), assaults (on Army person - nel\u2014A4), irresponsible work record (A6), impulsivity (no planning about breaking into the ATM\u2014A3), and lack of remorse (toward his mother and the girl he impregnated\u2014 A7). His symptoms touched on the areas of cognition, affect, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control (see the description of a general PD). Of course, he was now old enough (over 18\u2014criterion B) to qualify for a diagnosis of ASPD. People with a manic episode or schizophrenia will sometimes engage in criminal activity, but it is episodic and accompanied by other manic or psychotic symptoms. Milo steadfastly denied any behavior suggesting either a mood or a psychotic disorder (D). Patients with intellectual disability may break the law, either because they do not realize that it is wrong or because they are so easily influenced by others. Although Milo didn\u2019t do especially well in school, there is no indication that he was held back because of low intelligence. Because many addicted patients will do nearly anything to obtain money, sub - stance use disorders are important in the differential diagnosis. Milo had used cocaine and amphetamines, but (according to him) only briefly, and most of his antisocial behav- iors were not associated with drug use. Patients with impulse- control disorders will engage in",
    "do nearly anything to obtain money, sub - stance use disorders are important in the differential diagnosis. Milo had used cocaine and amphetamines, but (according to him) only briefly, and most of his antisocial behav- iors were not associated with drug use. Patients with impulse- control disorders will engage in illegal activities, but this is confined to the context of conduct disorder in younger people and fighting or property destruction in intermittent explosive disorder. Patients with bulimia nervosa sometimes shoplift, but Milo had no evidence of bulimic episodes. Of course, many of these conditions (as well as the anxiety disorders) can be encountered as associated diagnoses in patients with ASPD. Career criminals whose antisocial behavior is confined to their \u201cprofessional lives\u201d may not fulfill all of the criteria for ASPD. They may instead be diagnosed as having adult antisocial behavior, which would be recorded as Z72.811 [V71.01]. It constitutes part of the differential diagnosis of the PD. With a GAF score of 35, Milo\u2019s complete diagnosis would be as follows: 544 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS F60.2 [301.7] Antisocial personality disorder Z65.3 [V62.5] Arrest for ATM fraud F60.3 [301.83] Borderline Personality Disorder Throughout their adult lives, people with borderline PD (BPD) appear unstable. They\u2019re often at the crisis point as regards mood, behavior, or interpersonal relationships. Many feel empty and bored; they attach themselves strongly to others, then become intensely angry or hostile when they believe they are being ignored or mistreated by those they depend on. They may impulsively try to harm or mutilate themselves; these actions are expressions of anger, cries for help, or attempts to numb themselves to their emotional pain. Although patients with BPD may experience brief psychotic episodes, these resolve so quickly that they are seldom confused with psychoses like schizophrenia. Intense and rapid mood swings, impulsivity, and unstable interpersonal relationships make it difficult for these patients to achieve their full potential socially, at work, or in school. BPD runs in families. These people are truly miserable\u2014so much so that up to 10% complete suicide. The concept of b PD was devised about the middle of the 20th century. These patients were originally (and sometimes still are) said to hover between neurosis and psychosis\u2014a \u201cborderline\u201d whose existence is disputed by many clinicians. as the concept has evolved into a PD, it has achieved remarkable popularity, perhaps because so many patients can be shoehorned into its capacious definition.",
    "20th century. These patients were originally (and sometimes still are) said to hover between neurosis and psychosis\u2014a \u201cborderline\u201d whose existence is disputed by many clinicians. as the concept has evolved into a PD, it has achieved remarkable popularity, perhaps because so many patients can be shoehorned into its capacious definition. although 1\u20132% of the general population may legitimately qualify for a diagnosis of bPD, it is probably applied to a far greater proportion of the patients who seek mental health care. It may still be one of the most overdiagnosed conditions in the diagnostic manuals. Many of these patients have other disorders that are more readily treatable; these include major depressive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and substance- related disorders. Essential Features of Borderline Personality Disorder These patients exist in a perpetual crisis of mood or behavior. They often feel empty and bored. Disturbed identity (insecure self-image) can lead them to attach them - selves strongly to others and then reject these same people with equal vigor. On the other hand, they may frantically try to avert desertion (it can be actual or fanta- sied). Pronounced impulsiveness can lead them to harm or mutilate themselves or to engage in other potentially harmful behaviors, such as sexual indiscretions, spending sprees, eating binges, or reckless driving. Although stress can cause brief episodes of Borderline Personality Disorder 545 dissociation or paranoia, these quickly resolve. Intense, rapid mood swings may yield to anger that is inappropriate and uncontrolled.

Ow! There, I\u2019ve started.\u201d The voice howled with pain and rage. Twenty minutes later, the clinician had Josephine\u2019s address and her promise that she would come in to the emergency room right away. Two hours later, her left forearm swathed in bandages, Josephine Armitage was sitting in an office in the mental health department. Criss- crossing scars furrowed her right arm from wrist to elbow. She was 33, a bit overweight, and chewing gum. \u201cI feel a lot better,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI really think you saved my life.\u201d The clinician glanced at her nonswathed arm. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time, is it?\u201d",

Are you going to be terminally dense, just like my last shrink?\u201d She scowled and turned 90 degrees to look at the wall. \u201cSheesh!\u201d Her previous therapist had seen Josephine for a reduced fee, but had been unable to give her more time when she requested it. She had responded by letting the air out of all four tires of that clinician\u2019s new BMW. Her current trouble was with her boyfriend. One of her girlfriends had been \u201cpretty sure\u201d she\u2019d seen James with another woman two nights ago. Yesterday morn - ing, Josephine had called in sick to work and staked out James\u2019s workplace so she could confront him. He hadn\u2019t appeared, so last evening she had banged on the door of his apartment until neighbors threatened to call the police. Before leaving, she\u2019d kicked a hole in the wall beside his door. Then she got drunk and drove up and down the main drag, trying to pick up a date. \u201cSounds dangerous,\u201d observed the clinician. \u201cI was looking for Mr. Goodbar, but no one turned up. I decided I\u2019d have to cut myself again. It always seems to help.\u201d Josephine\u2019s anger had once again evaporated, and she had turned away from the wall. \u201cLife\u2019s a bitch, and then you die.\u201d \u201cWhen you cut yourself, do you ever really intend to kill yourself?\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s see.\u201d She chewed her gum thoughtfully. \u201cI get so angry and depressed, I just don\u2019t care what happens. My last shrink said all my life I\u2019ve felt like a shell of a person, and I guess that\u2019s right. It feels like there\u2019s no one living inside, so I might just as well pour out the blood and finish the job.\u201d 546 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS Evaluation of Josephine Armitage The first thing this clinician should do is to determine whether the behaviors reported (and observed) had been present since Josephine\u2019s late teen years.

    "Armitage The first thing this clinician should do is to determine whether the behaviors reported (and observed) had been present since Josephine\u2019s late teen years. From her report of the comment made by her \u201clast shrink,\u201d this would seem to be the case, but it should be verified. These behaviors were pervasive: Her work was affected (calling in sick on a whim), as were her relations with her boyfriend and her previous therapist. Josephine had an abundance of symptoms. The entire episode of staking out James\u2019s apartment could be seen as a frantic effort to avoid abandonment (BPD criterion A1). Even her initial moments with the present clinician revealed some swings between idealization and devaluation (criterion A2). She showed evidence of dangerous impul - sivity (driving while under the influence of alcohol, trying to pick up a stranger\u2014A4), and she had made repeated suicide attempts (A5). Her mood, even within the confines of this vignette, would seem markedly unstable and reactive to what she perceived to be the clinician\u2019s attitude toward her (A6); her anger was sudden, inappropriate, and intense (A8). She agreed with a description of herself as an \u201cempty shell\u201d (A7). Although patients with BPD are often described as having identity disturbance and occasional, brief psychotic lapses, Josephine\u2019s vignette gives no evidence of either of these. Even so, she had six or seven symptoms, whereas only five are required. A long list of other mental disorders can be confused with BPD; each must be considered before settling on this disorder as a sole (or principal) diagnosis. (This isn\u2019t a criterion for BPD, but it is one of the generic PD criteria, as well as one of my personal mantras.) Many patients with BPD also have major depressive disorder or dysthymia. It\u2019s important to establish that suicidal behaviors, anger, and feelings of emptiness are not experienced only during episodes of depression. Similarly, we need to know that affective instability is not due to cyclothymic disorder . Note that the official criteria don\u2019t mention any of these possibilities, but they are featured in the text. Patients with BPD can have psychotic episodes, but these tend to be brief and stress- related, and they resolve quickly and spontaneously\u2014all of which makes them unlikely to be confused with schizophrenia. The misuse of various substances can lead to suicide behavior, instability of mood, and reduced impulse control. Substance- related disorders are also often",

The misuse of various substances can lead to suicide behavior, instability of mood, and reduced impulse control. Substance- related disorders are also often found as concomitants with BPD, and should always be asked about carefully. Patients with somatic symptom disorder are often quite dramatic and may misuse substances and make suicide attempts. Although this vignette contains no evidence for any of these (other than getting drunk\u2014was this an isolated event?), the evaluating clinician would need to consider carefully the list just given. Patients with BPD can also show features of additional PDs. Josephine\u2019s presenta- tion was dramatic, suggesting histrionic PD. Patients with narcissistic PD are also self- centered, though they don\u2019t have Josephine\u2019s impulsivity. Patients with antisocial PD are impulsive and do not control their anger; although some of Josephine\u2019s behaviors were destructive, she did not engage in overtly criminal activity. Finally, dissociative identity disorder is sometimes encountered in patients with BPD. Further interviewing and observation would be needed to rule out this rare con- Borderline Personality Disorder 547 dition. Assuming the verification of Josephine\u2019s history, her diagnosis would be as given below. I would place her GAF score at 51.

If you encounter a patient whose character structure appears to have changed during the adult years, search for the cause until you find it. Usually, you\u2019ll turn up a personality change due to another medical condition, a mood or psychotic dis - order, something substance- related, a cognitive issue, or a severe adjustment disorder. F60.4 [301.50] Histrionic Personality Disorder Patients with histrionic PD (HPD) have a long- standing pattern of extreme attention seeking and emotionalism that seeps into all areas of their lives. These people satisfy their need to be at center stage in two main ways: (1) Their interests and topics of con- versation focus on their own desires and activities; and (2) they continually call atten - tion to themselves by their behavior, including speech. They are overly concerned with physical attractiveness (of themselves and of others, as it relates to them), and they will express themselves so extravagantly",
    "topics of con- versation focus on their own desires and activities; and (2) they continually call atten - tion to themselves by their behavior, including speech. They are overly concerned with physical attractiveness (of themselves and of others, as it relates to them), and they will express themselves so extravagantly that it can seem almost a parody of normal emo - tionality. Their need for approval can cause them to be seductive, often inappropriately (even flamboyantly) so. Many lead normal sex lives, but some will be promiscuous, and still others may be uninterested in sex. These people are often so insecure that they constantly seek the approval of other people. Dependence on the favor of others may cause their moods to seem shallow or excessively reactive to their surroundings. Low tolerance for frustration can spawn tem- per tantrums. They usually like to talk with mental health professionals (it is another chance to be the center of attention), but because their speech is often vague and full of exaggerations, they can prove frustrating to interview. Quick to form new friendships, people with HPD are also quick to become demanding. Because they are trusting and easily influenced, their behavior may appear inconsistent. They don\u2019t think very analytically, so they may have difficulty with tasks that require logical thinking, such as doing mental arithmetic. However, they may suc- ceed in jobs that set a premium on creativity and imagination. Their craving for novelty sometimes leads to legal problems as they seek sensation or stimulation. Some have a remarkable tendency to forget affect-laden material. HPD has not been especially well studied, but it is reportedly quite common. It may run in families. The classic patient is female, though the disorder can occur in men. 548 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS Essential Features of Histrionic Personality Disorder These patients not only crave the limelight, but are unhappy when they are not the focus of attention. They actively attempt to draw attention to themselves with their physical appearance and mannerisms. Their manner of speaking may be overly dra- matic, but what they say tends to be vague, lacking specificity. They can be gushing or effusive when expressing their emotions, which, however, tend to be superficial and fleeting. Too open to suggestion, too readily influenced, these people may inter- pret relationships as being intimate when they\u2019re not\u2014even to the extent of behav- ing in ways that are improperly suggestive",

I might as well be talking to the dog!\u201d Tears and mascara dripped onto the front of Angela\u2019s low-cut silk dress. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to listen to?\u201d Donald retorted. \u201cI know I irritate her, because she complains so much. But when I ask how she\u2019d like me to change, she can never put her finger on it.\u201d Angela and Donald were both 37 years old, and they had been married nearly 10 years. Already they had been separated twice. Donald made excellent money as a corporate lawyer; Angela had been a fashion model. She didn\u2019t work often any more, but her husband made enough to keep her well dressed and comfortably shod. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever worn the same dress twice,\u201d Donald grumbled. \u201cYes, I have,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cWhen? Name one time.\u201d \u201cI do it all the time. Especially recently.\u201d For several moments Angela defended herself, without ever making a concrete statement of fact. \u201cRes ipsa loquitur,\u201d said Donald with satisfaction. \u201cOh, God, Latin!\u201d She nearly howled. \u201cWhen he puts in his superior, gratuitous Latin, it makes me want to cut my wrists!\u201d The Blacks agreed on one thing: For them, this was a typical conversation. He worked late most nights and weekends, which upset her. She spent far too much money on jewelry and clothing. She relished the fact that she could still attract men. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it if you paid more attention to me,\u201d she said, pouting. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do it if you didn\u2019t listen to Marilyn,\u201d he retorted. Histrionic Personality Disorder 549 Marilyn and Angela had been best friends since their cheerleading days in high school.

Marilyn was wealthy and independent; she didn\u2019t care what people thought, and behaved accordingly. Usually Angela followed right along. \u201cLike the pool party last summer,\u201d put in Donald, \u201cwhen you took off your suits to \u2018practice cheers\u2019 for the races. Or was that your idea?\u201d \u201cWhat would you know about it? You were working late. Besides, it was only the tops.\u201d Evaluation of Angela Black Angela\u2019s personality style had a profound effect on her marriage, though the vignette hints that her other social relationships (for example, men at the party) were affected as well. More information would be needed to establish that she had been this way throughout her adult life. However, it would seem unlikely that her way of doing busi- ness with the world had developed recently. Angela\u2019s symptoms included a strong need to be the center of attention (HPD cri- terion A1) and sexual provocation (inferred from her dancing topless\u2014A2); excessive concern with physical appearance (A4); dramatic emotional expression (A6); suggest - ibility (following the lead of her friend Marilyn\u2014A7); and vague speech (commented on by her husband\u2014A5). I thought she might have expressed a touch of rapidly shifting emotional expression (A3), too, but maybe that\u2019s just me. Conservatively scored, she had at least six symptoms of HPD (five are required by the DSM-5 criteria). Her clinician should gather information adequate to determine that Angela did not have any of the major mental disorders that commonly accompany HPD. These include somatic symptom disorder (had she been in good physical health?) and substance- related disorders. Would Angela qualify for other PD diagnoses? She was centrally focused on herself, and she liked to be admired. However, she lacked the sense of grandiose accomplish - ment that characterizes patients with narcissistic PD. You can often identify histrionic features in people with borderline PD. Angela\u2019s mood was somewhat labile, but she did not report interpersonal instability, identity disturbance, transient paranoid ideation, or other symptoms that characterize borderline patients. Her easy suggestibility might suggest dependent PD, but she was so far from leaning on her husband for support that she actively fought with him. With a GAF score of 65, I\u2019d diagnose her as follows: F60.4 [301.50] Histrionic personality disorder Z63.0 [V61.10] Relationship",

These attitudes per- meate most aspects of their lives. They regard themselves as unusually special; they are 550 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS self- important individuals who commonly exaggerate their accomplishments. (From the outset, however, we need to note that these traits constitute a PD only in adults. Children and teenagers are naturally self- centered; in kids, narcissistic traits don\u2019t nec- essarily imply ultimate PD.) Despite their grandiose attitudes, people with NPD have fragile self- esteem and often feel unworthy; even at times of great personal success, they may feel fraudulent or undeserving. They remain overly sensitive to what others think about them, and feel compelled to extract compliments. When criticized, they may cover their distress with a fa\u00e7ade of icy indifference. As sensitive as they are about their own feelings, they have little apparent understanding of the feelings and needs of others and may feign empa - thy, just as they may lie to cover their own faults. Patients with NPD often fantasize about wild success and envy those who have achieved it. They may choose friends they think can help them get what they want. Job performance can suffer (due to interpersonal problems), or it can be enhanced (due to their eternal drive for success). Because they tend to be concerned with grooming and value their youthful looks, they may become increasingly depressed as they age. NPD has been seldom studied. It appears to occur in under 1% of the general population; reportedly, most patients are men. There is no information about family history, environmental antecedents, or other background material that might help us to understand these difficult personalities. Essential Features of Narcissistic Personality Disorder These people possess grandiosity, together with a craving for admiration.

To get it, they typically exaggerate their own abilities and accomplishments. They tend to be preoccupied with fantasies of beauty, brilliance, perfect love, power, or limitless success, and believe that they are so unusual that they should only associate with people or institutions of rarefied status. Often arrogant or haughty, they may believe that others envy them (though the reverse may actually be true). Lack of empathy engages their feelings of privilege in justifying the exploitation of others to achieve their own goals.

I\u2019ve got to have some help from you!\u201d Eleanor Bondurak, a social worker at the mental health clinic, Narcissistic Personality Disorder 551 was red-faced with anger and frustration. It wasn\u2019t the first time she had had difficulty working with this clinician. At the age of 50, Berna Whitlow had worked at nearly every mental health clinic in the metropolitan area. She was well trained and highly intelligent, and she read vora - ciously in her specialty. Those were the qualities that had landed her job after job over the years. The qualities that kept her moving from one job to another were known bet- ter to those who worked with her than to those who hired her. She was famous among her colleagues for being pompous and self- centered. \u201cShe said she wasn\u2019t going to take orders from me. And her attitude said for her, \u2018You\u2019re nothing but a social worker.\u2019 \u201d Eleanor was now reliving the moment in a heated discussion with the clinical director. \u201cShe said she\u2019d talk to my boss or to you.

    "I should \u2018write it up and submit it,\u2019 and she would \u2018decide what action to take.\u2019 That\u2019s when I had you paged.\u201d With the crisis over (the gun had been unloaded, the patient not dangerous), the clinical director had dropped in to chat with Dr. Whitlow. \u201cLook, Berna, it\u2019s true that ordinarily the social worker sees the patient and does a write-up before you step in. But this wasn\u2019t exactly an ordinary case! Especially in emergencies, the whole team has to act together.\u201d Berna Whitlow was tall, with a straight nose and jutting chin that seemed to radi - ate authority. Her long hair was thick and blond. She raised her chin a bit higher. \u201cYou hardly need to lecture me on the team approach. I\u2019ve been a leader in nearly every clinic in town. I\u2019m a superb team leader. You can ask anyone.\u201d As she spoke, she rubbed the gold rings that encircled nearly every finger. \u201cBut being a team leader involves more than just giving orders. It\u2019s also about gath- ering information, building consensus, caring about the feelings of oth\u2014\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d she interrupted, \u201cit\u2019s her job to work on my team. It\u2019s my job to provide the leadership and make the decisions.\u201d Evaluation of Berna Whitlow From the material we have (which does not include a clinical interview, so our conclu- sions must be tentative), Dr. Whitlow\u2019s personality traits would seem to have caused difficulties for many years. They affected her life broadly, interfering with work (many jobs) and interpersonal relationships. Of course, a full assessment would inquire about her personality as it affected her home and social life. Symptoms suggestive of NPD included her haughty attitude (NPD criterion A9), exaggerating her own accomplishments (\u201cI\u2019m a superb team leader\u201d\u2014A1), insisting that she receive orders or requests only from persons of high rank (A3), expecting obedience (from a sense of entitlement\u2014A5), and lacking empathy with fellow workers (A7). Five criteria are needed; affective, cognitive, and interpersonal features were present (see the Essential Features of a general PD). 552 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS Several other PDs can either accompany or be confused with NPD.

    "confused with NPD. Patients with histrionic PD are also extremely self- centered, but Dr. Whitlow was not as theatrical (although she did wear a lot of rings). As is the case in borderline PD (and most other PDs), patients with NPD have a great deal of trouble relating to other people. But they (including Dr. Whitlow) are not especially prone to unstable moods, suicidal behavior, or brief psychoses under stress. Although there is a hint of the deceitful in narcissistic exaggerations, these people lack the pervasive criminality and disregard for the rights of others that are typical of antisocial PD. Although dysthymia and major depressive disorder frequently accompany NPD, there is no evidence in the vignette to support either of those diagnoses. Dr. Whitlow\u2019s tentative diagnosis (GAF score of 61) would be as follows: F60.81 [301.81] Narcissistic personality disorder Cluster C Personality Disorders Patients with Cluster C PDs are characteristically anxious, tense, and overcontrolled. F60.6 [301.82] Avoidant Personality Disorder People with avoidant PD (APD) feel inadequate, are socially inhibited, and are overly sensitive to criticism. These characteristics are present throughout adult life, and affect most aspects of daily life. (Like narcissistic traits, avoidant traits are common in chil - dren and don\u2019t necessarily imply eventual PD.) Their sensitivity to criticism and disapproval makes these people self- effacing and eager to please others, but it can also lead to marked social isolation. They may misin - terpret innocent comments as critical; often they refuse to begin a relationship unless they are sure they will be accepted. They will hang back in social situations for fear of saying something foolish, and may avoid occupations that involve social demands. Other than their parents, siblings, or children, they tend to have few close friends. Comfortable with routine, they may go to great lengths to avoid departing from their set ways. In an interview they can appear tense and anxious; they may misinterpret even benign statements as criticism. Although APD has appeared in the DSMs since 1980, relevant research is still sparse. In frequency, it occupies middle ground (about 2% of the general population) as PDs go, roughly equal for men and women. Many such patients marry and work, although they may become depressed or anxious if they lose their support systems. Sometimes this disorder is associated with having a disfiguring illness or condi - tion. APD is not often seen clinically; these patients tend",

Sometimes this disorder is associated with having a disfiguring illness or condi - tion. APD is not often seen clinically; these patients tend to come to evaluation only when another illness supervenes. There is considerable overlap with social anxiety disorder. Avoidant Personality Disorder 553 Essential Features of Avoidant Personality Disorder These patients are socially inhibited, are overly sensitive to criticism, and feel inade- quate. Feeling themselves inferior, unappealing, or clumsy, they are reluctant to form new relationships. Such people so fear ridicule or shame that they will only become involved with others if they can know in advance they will be accepted. Otherwise, their worry about being rejected or criticized (or embarrassed) on the job or in social situations will lead them to avoid new pursuits.

At least, that\u2019s what his new acquaintances in Alcoholics Anonymous had told him. One had reminded him that 30 days\u2019 sobriety was \u201ctime enough to detox every last cell\u201d in his body. Another thought he was having a \u201cdry drunk.\u201d \u201cWhatever a \u2018dry drunk\u2019 is,\u201d Jack observed later. \u201cAll I know is that after 5 weeks without alcohol, I\u2019m feeling every bit as bad as I did 15 years ago, before I\u2019d ever had a drop. I\u2019ve enjoyed hangovers more than this!\u201d At age 32, Jack had a lot of hangovers to choose from. He\u2019d had his first drink when he was only a senior in high school. He had been a strange, lonely sort of kid who\u2019d had a great deal of difficulty meeting other people. While he was still in high school, he had begun to lose his hair; now, with the exception of his eyebrows and eyelashes, he was totally bald. He was also afflicted with a slight, persistent nodding of his head. \u201cTituba- tion,\u201d the neurologist had said; \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d The sight of his balding, nodding head in the mirror every morning looked grotesque, even to Jack.

As a teenager he found it almost impossible to form relationships; he was positive that no one could like someone as peculiar as he was. Then one evening Jack found alcohol. \u201cRight from the first drink, I knew I\u2019d dis - covered something important. With two beers on board, I forgot all about my head. I even asked a girl out. She turned me down, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter that much. I had found a life.\u201d But the following morning, he found that he still had his old personality. He experimented for months before he learned when and how much he could drink and maintain a glow sufficiently rosy to help him feel well, but not too rosy to function. During a 3-week period in his senior year at law school when he sobered up completely, he discovered that without alcohol, he still had the same old feelings of isolation and rejection. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not drinking, I don\u2019t feel sad or anxious,\u201d Jack observed. \u201cBut I\u2019m lonely 554 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS and uncomfortable with myself, and I feel that other people will feel the same about me. I guess that\u2019s why I just don\u2019t make friends.\u201d After law school, Jack went to work for a small firm that specialized in corporate law. They called him \u201cThe Mole,\u201d because he spent nearly all of every work day in the law library doing research. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel comfortable meeting the clients\u2014I never get along well with new people.\u201d The only exception to this lifestyle was Jack\u2019s membership in the stamp club. From his grandfather, he had inherited a large collection of commemorative plate blocks. When he took these to the Philatelic Society, he thought they\u2019d welcome him with open arms, and they did. He continued to build upon his grandfather\u2019s collection and attended meetings once a month. \u201cI guess I feel OK there because I don\u2019t have to worry whether they\u2019ll like me. I\u2019ve got a great stamp collection for them to admire.\u201d Evaluation of Jack Weiblich Jack\u2019s symptoms were pervasive (profoundly affecting his work and social life) and had been present long enough (since he",

I\u2019ve got a great stamp collection for them to admire.\u201d Evaluation of Jack Weiblich Jack\u2019s symptoms were pervasive (profoundly affecting his work and social life) and had been present long enough (since he was a teenager) to qualify for a PD. They included the following typical APD features: He avoided interpersonal contact (for example, with clients at the law firm\u2014 criterion A1); he felt that he was unappealing (A6); although he joined the stamp club, he was pretty sure that his collection would be accepted (A2); he worried a lot about being rejected (A4). Only four criteria are needed; cognitive, occu- pational, and interpersonal areas were involved for Jack Weiblich (see the Essential Features for a general PD). Depression and anxiety are both common in patients with APD. Therefore, it is important to search for evidence of mood disorders and anxiety disorders (especially social anxiety disorder) in patients who avoid contact with others. Jack stated explicitly that he felt neither sad nor anxious, but he admitted that he had severely misused alco- hol. The substance- related disorders also commonly bring a patient with APD to the attention of mental health care providers. In both APD and schizoid PD, patients spend most of their time alone. The differ- ence, of course, is that patients with APD are unhappy with their condition, whereas people with schizoid PD prefer it that way. A somewhat more difficult differential diag- nosis may be that between APD and dependent PD . (Dependent patients avoid posi- tions of responsibility, as Jack did.) Note that Jack\u2019s avoidant lifestyle may have been bound up in his twin physical peculiarities, his baldness and nodding head. Although Jack had an alcohol use disorder, his clinician felt that it was causing him little current difficulty and that the PD was the fundamental problem needing treat - ment (other clinicians might argue with this interpretation). That\u2019s why the PD was listed as his principal diagnosis. Of course, he didn\u2019t qualify for any course modifiers for alcohol use disorder, because he\u2019d only been on the wagon for 5 weeks (p. 409); I thought his alcoholism was pretty mild, actually (and note that the PD doesn\u2019t enter into the coding of the substance use disorder; see Table 15.2 in Chapter 15).

Because they desperately fear separation, their behavior becomes so submissive and clinging that it may result in others\u2019 taking advantage of them or rejecting them. Anxiety blossoms if they are thrust into a position of leadership, and they feel helpless and uncomfortable when they are alone. Because they typically need much reassurance, they may have trouble making decisions. Such patients have trouble starting projects and sticking to a job on their own, though they may do well under the careful direction of someone else. They tend to belittle themselves and to agree with people who they know are wrong. They may also tolerate considerable abuse (even battering). Though it may occur commonly, this condition has not been well studied. Some writers believe that it is difficult to distinguish it from avoidant PD. It has been found more often among women than men. Bud Stanhope, a patient with the sleep terror type of non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder, also had DPD; his history is given on page 334. Essential Features of Dependent Personality Disorder The need for supportive relationships draws these people into clinging, submissive behavior and fears of separation. Fear of disapproval makes it hard to disagree with others; to gain support, they will even take extraordinary steps, such as assuming unpleasant tasks. Low self- confidence prevents them from starting or carrying out projects independently; indeed, they want others to take responsibility for their own major life areas. If they do make even everyday decisions, they require lots of advice and reassurance. Exaggerated, unrealistic fears of abandonment and the notion that they cannot care for themselves will cause these people to feel helpless or uncom - fortable when alone; they may desperately seek a replacement for a lost close per - sonal relationship.

She was never sick or absent, and she could do anything\u2014she\u2019d even had some bookkeeping experience. Her supervisor noted that she was polite on the phone, typed like a demon, and would volunteer for anything. When the building main- tenance crew went out on strike, Janet came in early every day for a week to clean the toilets and sinks. But still, somehow, she just wasn\u2019t working out. Her supervisor complained that Janet needed too much direction, even for simple things\u2014such as what sort of paper to type form letters on. When she was asked what she thought the answer should be, her judgment was good, but she always wanted guidance anyway. Her constant need for reassurance took an inordinate amount of her supervisor\u2019s time. That was why she had been referred to the company mental health consultant for an evaluation. At 28, Janet was slender, attractive, and carefully dressed. Her chestnut hair already showed streaks of gray. She appeared at the doorway of the office and asked, \u201cWhere would you like me to sit?\u201d Once she started talking, she spoke readily about her life and her work. She had always felt timid and unsure of herself. She and her two sisters had grown up with a father who was affectionate but dictatorial; their mouse of a mother seemed to welcome his loving tyranny. At her mother\u2019s knee, Janet had learned obedience well. When Janet was 18, her father suddenly died; within a few months, her mother remarried and moved to another state. Janet felt bereft and panic- stricken. Instead of beginning college, she took a job as a teller in a bank; soon afterward, she married one of her customers. He was a 30-year-old bachelor, set in his ways, and he soon let it be known",

He was a 30-year-old bachelor, set in his ways, and he soon let it be known that he preferred to make all of the couple\u2019s decisions himself. For the first time in a year, Janet relaxed. But even security bred its own anxieties. \u201cSometimes at night I wake up, wonder- ing what I\u2019d do if I lost him,\u201d Janet told the interviewer. \u201cIt makes my heart beat so fast I think it might stop from exhaustion. I just don\u2019t think I could manage on my own.\u201d Evaluation of Janet Greenspan Janet had the following symptoms of DPD: She needed considerable advice to make everyday decisions (criterion A1); she wanted her husband to make their decisions (A2); panic- stricken when her father died and her mother left town, she fled into an early marriage (A7); she feared being left to fend for herself, even though she had had no indication that this was likely (A8). She even volunteered to clean the office toilet, prob- ably to secure the favor of the rest of the staff (A5). We have no evidence that she was reluctant to disagree with others, but otherwise the criteria fit like a rubber glove. Five are needed for diagnosis. Janet reported that she had been this way since childhood; from the history, her character traits would seem to have affected both work and social life. Fortunately, she married someone whose need to be in charge matched her depen- Dependent Personality Disorder 557 dency. Cognitive, affective, and interpersonal areas were involved (see the criteria for a general PD). Dependent behavior is found in several mental disorders that Janet did not appear to have, including somatic symptom disorder and agoraphobia. The person with the secondary psychosis in what used to be called folie \u00e0 deux (or shared psychotic disor - der\u2014now it is usually diagnosed as delusional disorder ) often has a dependent per - sonality.

    "Major depressive disorder and dysthymia are important in the differential diagnosis; either of these may become prominent when patients lose those upon whom they depend. Even if Janet had all the required physiological symptoms for general - ized anxiety disorder, she would not be given this diagnosis, because her worries were evidently limited to fears of abandonment. Patients with DPD must be differentiated from those with histrionic PD, who are impressionable and easily influenced by others (but Janet did not seem to be especially attention- seeking). Other PDs usually included in the differential diagnosis are border- line and avoidant. With a GAF score of 70, Janet\u2019s diagnosis would be simple: F60.7 [301.6] Dependent personality disorder F60.5 [301.4] Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive Personality Disorder People with obsessive\u2013 compulsive PD (OCPD) are perfectionistic and preoccupied with orderliness; they need to exert interpersonal and mental control. These traits exist on a lifelong basis, at the expense of efficiency, flexibility, and candor. However, OCPD is not just obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder (OCD) in miniature. Many patients with OCPD have no actual obsessions or compulsions at all, though some do eventually develop OCD. The rigid perfectionism of these patients often results in indecisiveness, preoccu - pation with detail, scrupulosity, and insistence that others do things their way. These behaviors can interfere with their effectiveness in work or social situations. Often they seem depressed, and this depression may wax and wane, perhaps to the point that it drives them into treatment. Sometimes these people are stingy; they may be savers, refusing to throw away even worthless objects they no longer need. They may have trouble expressing affection. Patients with OCPD are list makers who allocate their own time poorly, worka - holics who must meticulously plan even their own pleasure. They may plan their own vacations only to postpone them. They resist the authority of others, but insist on their own. They may be perceived as stilted, stiff, or moralistic. This condition is probably fairly common; prevalence in various studies centers around 5%. It is diagnosed more often in males than in females, and it probably runs in families. 558 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS Essential Features of Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive Personality Disorder These people are intensely focused on control, orderliness, and perfection.

Born in Mumbai and educated in London, Robin was a graduate student in biol - ogy. Now she spent part of her time as a teaching assistant in biology, and the rest struggling through her own coursework at a major U.S. university. She gazed steadily at the interviewer. According to her preceptor, a slightly dour Scot named MacLeish who had asked her to come for the interview, the problem wasn\u2019t neatness. It was completing the work. Every paper she turned in was wonderful\u2014every fact was there, every conclusion cor- rect, not even a misspelling. He had asked her why she couldn\u2019t learn to let go of them a little sooner, \u201cbefore the rats die of old age?\u201d She had thought it funny at the time, but it made her think. Robin had always been orderly. Her mother had made her keep neat little lists of her chores, and the habit stuck. Robin admitted that she became so \u201clost in lists\u201d that sometimes she hardly had time to finish her work. Her students seemed fond of her, but several had said they wished she\u2019d give them more responsibility. One had told Dr. MacLeish that Robin seemed afraid even to let them do their own dissections; their methods weren\u2019t as compulsively correct as hers were, so she\u2019d try to do them herself.

Finally, she also admitted that nearly every night, her work habits kept her in the lab until late. It had been weeks since she\u2019d had a date\u2014or any social life at all. This real - ization was what spurred her to follow Dr. MacLeish\u2019s advice and come in for a mental health evaluation. Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive Personality Disorder 559 Evaluation of Robin Chatterjee Although the prototype for OCPD seems a pretty good fit for Robin, she would just barely meet the official criteria. She was workaholic and perfectionistic (OCPD criteria A3 and A2), to the point that these traits interfered with the learning of her students. She had a great deal of difficulty delegating work\u2014even the students\u2019 own dissections (A6)! And she concentrated so fiercely on her lists of tasks that she sometimes didn\u2019t accomplish the tasks themselves (A1). She had had these tendencies throughout her young adult life. Depressed mood is common in these people. The common disorders that should be looked for in a patient with OCPD include OCD itself, major depressive disorder, and dysthymia. Robin was not depressed and, unlike so many patients with OCPD, seemed to have no other disorder. Because she barely met the criteria and was func - tioning well overall, I would place her GAF score at a relatively high 70. F60.5 [301.4] Obsessive\u2013 compulsive personality disorder Other Personality Conditions F07.0 [310.1] Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition Some medical conditions can cause a personality change, which is defined as an altera- tion (usually, a worsening) of a patient\u2019s previous personality traits. If the medical condi- tion occurs early enough in childhood, the change can last throughout the person\u2019s life. Most instances of personality change are caused by an injury to the brain or by some other central nervous system disorder, such as epilepsy or Huntington\u2019s disease; how - ever, systemic diseases that affect the brain (for example, systemic lupus erythematosis) are also sometimes implicated. Several sorts of personality changes commonly occur. Mood may become unsta - ble, perhaps with outbursts of rage or suspiciousness; other patients may become apathetic and passive. Changes in mood are especially common with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy may become overly reli- gious,",
    "of personality changes commonly occur. Mood may become unsta - ble, perhaps with outbursts of rage or suspiciousness; other patients may become apathetic and passive. Changes in mood are especially common with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy may become overly reli- gious, verbose, and lacking in a sense of humor; some may turn markedly aggressive. Paranoid ideas are also common. Belligerence can accompany outbursts of temper, to the extent that the social judgment of some patients becomes markedly impaired. Use the type specifiers in the Coding Notes to categorize the nature of the personality change. If there is a major alteration in the structure of the brain, these personality changes will probably persist. If the problem stems from a correctable chemical problem, they may resolve. When severe, they can ultimately lead to dementia, as is sometimes the case in patients with multiple sclerosis. 560 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS Essential Features of Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition A physical illness or injury appears to have caused a patient to suffer a lasting per - sonality change.

Eddie Ortway Eddie Ortway, now age 28, had been born in central Los Angeles, where he was reared by his mother\u2014 whenever she was neither hospitalized (for drug and alcohol use) nor jailed (for prostitution). His parents, Eddie always suspected, had been only briefly acquainted. Eddie avoided school whenever possible, and grew up with no role model in sight. His principal accomplishment was learning to use his fists. By the time he was 15, he and his gang had participated in several turf wars. He was making a name for himself as an aggressive enemy.

    "had participated in several turf wars. He was making a name for himself as an aggressive enemy. But Eddie was not a criminal, and the necessity for earning a living soon set him to work. With little education and no training, he found his opportunities pretty much limited to fast food and hard labor. Sometimes he held several jobs at a time. But, as an Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition 561 old probation report noted, he still had \u201ca raging sense of injustice.\u201d Although he gradu- ally stopped associating with his gang, through his middle 20s he continued to deal aggressively with any situation that seemed to require direct action. His 27th birthday was one of these. Eddie was delivering a pizza to an apart - ment building in his old neighborhood when he encountered a teenager forcing an old woman into an alley at gunpoint. Eddie stepped forward and for his pains received a bullet that entered his head through the left eye socket and exited at the hairline. He was admitted to the hospital by way of the operating room, where surgeons debrided his wound. He never even lost consciousness and was released in less than a week. But he didn\u2019t return to work. The social worker\u2019s report noted that Eddie\u2019s physi- cal condition had rebounded within a month, but that he \u201clacked drive.\u201d He appeared for every scheduled job interview, but his prospective employers uniformly reported that he \u201cjust didn\u2019t seem very interested in working.\u201d \u201cI needed time to recuperate,\u201d Eddie told the interviewer. He was a good- looking young man whose hair had begun receding from his forehead. An incisional scar ran up onto his scalp. \u201cI still don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite ready.\u201d He had been recuperating for 2 years. Now he was being tested to try to learn why. Other than a slight droop to his left eyelid, his neurological examination was completely normal. An EEG showed some slow waves over the frontal lobes; the MRI revealed a localized absence of brain tissue. Eddie never failed to cooperate with testing procedures, and all of the clinicians who examined him noted that he was polite and pleasant.

He complies but never anticipates, and he shows little interest in the proceedings.\u201d His affect was about medium and showed almost no lability. His speech was clear, coherent, and relevant. He denied delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, compulsions, or phobias. When asked what he was interested in, he thought for a few seconds and then answered that he guessed he was interested in going back home. He made a per- fect score on the MMSE. In the time since his injury, Eddie admitted, he had lived on workers\u2019 compensa - tion and spent most of his time watching television. He didn\u2019t argue with anyone any more. When one examiner asked him what he would do if he again saw someone being mugged, he shrugged and said that he thought people should \u201cjust live and let live.\u201d Evaluation of Eddie Ortway Eddie\u2019s history and examinations presented an obvious general medical cause for his persistent personality change (criterion A). Note that it was the physiology of trauma to the brain that produced Eddie\u2019s personality change. This is the explicit requirement (B) for this diagnosis, which cannot be made when personality change accompanies a nonspecific medical condition such as severe pain. Eddie\u2019s normal attention span and lack of memory deficit would rule out delirium (D) and major neurocognitive disorder (dementia); however, neuropsychological test- 562 PErSONALITY DISOr DErS ing should be requested. A PD such as dependent PD could not explain Eddie\u2019s condi- tion, because his behavior represented a marked change from his premorbid person - ality (that is, the way he was until his injury). And the features of Eddie\u2019s personality change were not better explained by a different physically induced mental disorder. A mood disorder due to brain trauma would be one of several possible examples. Besides head trauma, a variety of neurological conditions can cause personality change. These include multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents, brain tumors, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Other causes of behavioral change that could resemble a change in personality include delusional disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and schizophrenia. But Eddie\u2019s personality change began abruptly after he was shot, and he had no prior history that was consistent with any of the other disorders mentioned (C).

But Eddie\u2019s personality change began abruptly after he was shot, and he had no prior history that was consistent with any of the other disorders mentioned (C). However, many other patients experience apparent personality change associated with mental disorders, including addiction to substances. The fact that Eddie\u2019s condition impaired him both occupationally and socially completed the criteria (E) for this diagnosis. In his clinical picture, apathy (and pas - sivity) clearly stood out as the main feature. This determined the specific subtype. His GAF score would be a heart- breaking 55.

Here\u2019s my problem with that strategy: We would be branding someone who may be much less impaired than is the typical patient with a PD. My personal belief is that it would be better just to note in the summary the traits we\u2019ve identified, and not make a firm diagnosis of any sort. Unspecified Personality Disorder 563 564 CHAPTEr 18 Paraphilic Disorders Quick Guide to the Paraphilic Disorders The paraphilias include a variety of sexual behaviors that most people reject as distaste - ful, unusual, or abnormal: They involve something other than genital sex with a normal, consenting adult. A paraphilic disorder is diagnosed when a person feels distressed or is impaired by such a behavior. Nearly all of them are practiced largely, perhaps exclusively, by males. Exhibitionistic disorder. The patient has urges for genital exposure to a stranger who does not expect it (p. 567). Fetishistic disorder. The patient has sexual urges related to the use of inanimate objects (p. 569). Frotteuristic disorder. The patient has urges related to rubbing his genitals against a person who has not consented to this (p. 571). Pedophilic disorder. The patient has urges involving sexual activities with children (p. 574). Sexual masochism disorder. The patient has sexual urges related to being injured, bound, or humiliated (p. 578).

The patient has sexual urges related to being injured, bound, or humiliated (p. 578). Sexual sadism disorder. The patient has sexual urges related to inflicting suffering or humili- ation on someone else (p. 580). Transvestic disorder. An individual has sexual urges related to cross- dressing (p. 583). Voyeuristic disorder. The patient has urges related to viewing some unsuspecting person disrobing, naked, or engaging in sexual activity (p. 586). Other specified, or unspecified, paraphilic disorder. Quite a few paraphilic disorders are not widely practiced or have received too little clinical attention to warrant codes of their own (p. 588). Introduction Defining Paraphilias and Paraphilic Disorders Literally, paraphilia means \u201cabnormal or unnatural affection.\u201d Paraphilic sexual rela - tionships differ from normal ones with respect to the preferred sexual objects or to how an individual relates to those objects. (Let us take normal to mean sex activity that focuses on genital stimulation with a consenting adult partner.) These sexual activi - ties revolve around themes of (1) inanimate objects or nonhuman animals; (2) humilia - tion or suffering of the patient or partner; or (3) nonconsenting persons, including chil- dren. DSM-5 alternatively divides paraphilias into those that involve abnormal target preferences (children, fetishes, cross- dressing) and those involving abnormal activities (exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism, masochism, frotteurism). There are many additional paraphilias in the world; those listed in DSM-5 are those that are more common and, in some cases, have a greater impact. We must further differentiate between a paraphilia and a paraphilic disorder. The latter is a paraphilia that causes distress to the individual or harm to other people. This distinction allows a bit of parsimony in dispensing mental health diagnoses. For exam- ple, we don\u2019t have to attach a label of disorder to the behavior of a cross- dresser who is comfortable with and in no important way inconvenienced by the behavior. (In a 1991 survey of college students, over half admitted they engaged in some sort of paraphilic behavior.) In short, we identify the paraphilia by the urge, but the paraphilic disorder by the distress or impairment the urge provokes. Mere desire or fantasy about these sexual activities can upset some patients enough to warrant a diagnosis, but it\u2019s far more common for patients to act upon their desires. (Indeed, DSM-5",
    "we identify the paraphilia by the urge, but the paraphilic disorder by the distress or impairment the urge provokes. Mere desire or fantasy about these sexual activities can upset some patients enough to warrant a diagnosis, but it\u2019s far more common for patients to act upon their desires. (Indeed, DSM-5 carefully states that a person who claims to have no distress or dis - ability\u2014work/educational, social, personal, or other impairment\u2014can still receive the diagnosis if the ideas have been repeatedly acted upon.) In descending order, the most common paraphilic disorders are pedophilic, exhibitionistic, voyeuristic, and frotteur - istic. The rest are encountered much less frequently. Several of these behaviors involve victims who do not consent. Frotteurs, voyeurs, sadists, and exhibitionists are acutely aware of their precarious legal state and usually take pains to avoid detection or to plan their escape. Pedophiles may delude themselves that what they are doing somehow benefits the children they target (\u201ceducation,\u201d per - haps), but they nonetheless caution their victims not to tell their parents\u2014or anyone else. Patients who seek clinical help because they have run afoul of the law may not reliably describe the motivation for their activities. Paraphilic behavior may represent a high percentage of sexual episodes for many patients, whereas others may only indulge themselves occasionally, perhaps when under stress. Many patients have multiple paraphilias (the average is three or four). They may move from one paraphilic behavior to another, and may switch between classes of victim identified by gender, age, touching versus nontouching, and intra- ver- sus extrafamilial status. Introduction 565 Although none of the criteria specify gender, apart from pedophiles, almost all patients with paraphilic disorders are male. Most fantasize sexual contact with their victims. A paraphilic disorder is hardly ever due to another medical condition. However, unusual sexual behavior may be encountered in several other mental disorders: schizo- phrenia, bipolar I disorder (manic episodes), intellectual disability, and obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder. In addition, personality pathology is frequently a concomitant of paraphilic behavior. although none of these criteria sets specify age, most paraphilias begin during adoles - cence. This is also the time when people begin to discover and explore their sexuality; ado- lescent boys, in particular, typically experiment with a variety of sexual behaviors. How - ever, any teenager so involved with paraphilic behavior as to meet the diagnostic criteria that appear below should also be considered a candidate for",
    "the time when people begin to discover and explore their sexuality; ado- lescent boys, in particular, typically experiment with a variety of sexual behaviors. How - ever, any teenager so involved with paraphilic behavior as to meet the diagnostic criteria that appear below should also be considered a candidate for diagnosis. It should also be noted that the boundaries of what is considered normal in human sexual behavior are not sharply drawn. although pedophilia is universally condemned, even by imprisoned felons, most other paraphilias have parallel behaviors in the general popula- tion. Revealing oneself, watching, and touching constitute part of everyday sexual experi- ence. Even coercion and pain (in moderation) figure in the sexual activities of many people whose sex lives would be considered fairly conventional. cross- dressing has for centuries been an important part of theater. I admit that I have trouble imagining a \u201cnormal\u201d context for fetishism, however. Specifiers for the Paraphilic Disorders Note that, for each of the paraphilic disorders, there are two specifiers you can use to indicate that the person is no longer pursuing that particular behavior. Each of these specifiers is more likely to be applied to someone whose behavior can lead to legal difficulties\u2014 specifically, patients with exhibitionistic, frotteuristic, pedophilic, voy - euristic, and sometimes sexual sadism disorders. In a controlled environment is intended for patients who are currently living in places that physically prevent pursuit of their paraphilic interests. These would include prisons, hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities locked against the unsupervised freedom to roam. In remission is a less restrictive term you can add to the diagnosis of a person who is not living in a controlled environment, yet has had no recurrence of the behavior in question and no distress or impairment from it for at least 5 years. 566 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS F65.2 [302.4] Exhibitionistic Disorder Although no one knows just how many exhibitionists there are in the world, exhibi - tionism is one of the most commonplace sexual offenses (second only to voyeurism). Despite the fact that some women turn up in general population surveys, people who come to clinical or legal attention are almost invariably male, and their victims are nearly always female. In most cases, the victims are unsuspecting strangers; however, a small percentage of exposures are made to people known to the exhibitionist. Men who expose themselves to children may be quite different from those",
    "to clinical or legal attention are almost invariably male, and their victims are nearly always female. In most cases, the victims are unsuspecting strangers; however, a small percentage of exposures are made to people known to the exhibitionist. Men who expose themselves to children may be quite different from those who expose to adults; for example, their recidivism rate is higher. An exhibitionist tends to follow the same pattern with each offense. He may fan - tasize while driving around looking for a victim (often he is careful to leave himself an escape route to use if spotted by someone other than the victim). One individual may expose himself with an erection; another may be flaccid. Some are quite aggressive, savoring the look of shock or terror they produce. An exhibitionist may masturbate when he shows himself to the woman or later when he relives the scene in his imagi - nation. Many will fantasize having sex with their victims, but most exhibitionists don\u2019t attempt to act upon such fantasies. Exhibitionism usually begins before the age of 18, but it may persist until 30 or later. Often the urge to exhibit comes in waves: The patient may yield daily for a week or two, then remain inactive for weeks or months. Exhibitionistic behavior most often occurs when a patient is either under stress or has free time. The use of alcohol is sel - dom a factor. Many exhibitionists have spouses or partners and pursue relatively normal sex lives, though their interest in sex may be greater than average. Although the behavior has traditionally been regarded as more a nuisance than an actual danger to others, it can coexist with other paraphilias. Perhaps 15% will have an offense involving contact, such as coercion, pedophilia, or rape. Clearly, a full assessment of paraphilic interests is indicated for any patient involved in exhibitionism. Essential Features of Exhibitionistic Disorder The person is aroused by genital self- exposure to an unwary stranger and has repeat- edly acted on the urge (or feels distress/disability at the idea).

He referred himself because of the anxiety symptoms he developed after he became concerned that a woman would report him for displaying his erect penis at the swimming pool of the apartment complex where they both lived. \u201cI thought she had been looking at me in an interested way,\u201d he said, smoothing back his toupee. \u201cShe was wearing a very skimpy bikini, and I thought she was inviting me to reveal myself. So I sat in such a way that she could look up the leg of my swim - ming trunks.\u201d Ronald had gone to law school on a scholarship. He had grown up in an inner-city neighborhood that included Hoofer\u2019s, a strip-tease joint not far from the Navy recruit - ing station. When he was in grade school, his friends and he sometimes sneaked in through a side door to watch part of the show. On a dare when he was 15, he pulled down his pants in front of two strippers who were just leaving the building. The women laughed and applauded; later, he masturbated as he fantasized that they were fondling him. From time to time after that, through college and law school, Ronald would occa - sionally drive around \u201ctrolling,\u201d as he called it\u2014 looking for a girl or young woman walk- ing by herself in a secluded area. As he drove, he would masturbate. When he found the right combination of circumstances (a woman who took his fancy in a secluded location, with no one else around), he would hop out of his car and confront the woman with his erection. Often the look of surprise on her face would cause him to ejaculate. With his marriage, which coincided with his graduation from law school, Ronald\u2019s exhibitionistic activity subsided for a time. Although sexual intercourse with his wife",

With his marriage, which coincided with his graduation from law school, Ronald\u2019s exhibitionistic activity subsided for a time. Although sexual intercourse with his wife was fully satisfactory to both of them, he continued to imagine showing himself to a stranger, with whom he would then fantasize having intercourse. As a practicing law - yer, he sometimes had afternoons when a continued court case left him at loose ends. Then he might go trolling again, sometimes several times in a month. At other times he might go months without activity. 568 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS About the woman at the swimming pool, Ronald said, \u201cI really think she did want to.\u201d Her bikini had been very revealing, and he\u2019d been thinking for several days about having sex with her. He contrived to sit so that she was virtually sure to glance between his thighs. When she noticed what he had intended her to see, her response was \u201cThat confirms what I\u2019ve always thought about lawyers!\u201d Since then he had been in near- panic at the thought that she would notify the state bar association. Evaluation of Ronald Spivey Ronald\u2019s history of experiencing excitement from exhibiting himself to a nonconsenting person dated to his teenage years and had persisted for at least two decades (criteria A, B). If he were apprehended, he could lose his livelihood, if not his liberty. The fact that he continued this illegal behavior despite its possible consequences indicates the strength of his urge. (Note that whereas \u201ctrolling\u201d is typical behavior for an exhibition- ist, exposing himself to someone he might expect to meet again is not\u2014though it\u2019s hardly unheard of.) Ronald\u2019s assumption that the woman wanted him to \u201creveal\u201d himself is fairly typi- cal of the cognitive distortion to which these people fall prey. It would be a pretty unusual woman who took any interest at all in a relative stranger who flashed her at a public swimming pool. Although it is possible that another mental disorder could present together with exhibitionistic disorder, it is unlikely that either schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder would have been present for over 20 years without detection and thus account for the behavior. Of course, intellectual disability would have prevented Ronald from entering, much less completing, law",

Of course, intellectual disability would have prevented Ronald from entering, much less completing, law school. The clinician should take pains to fully evaluate Ron- ald for additional paraphilic disorders, as well as for substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders. I\u2019d also make a note to self: \u201cSearch for personality traits at next interview.\u201d Ronald\u2019s exclusive interest in adult women would dictate the specifier; he was not currently in remission, so his complete diagnosis (GAF score of 65) would be as follows: F65.2 [302.4] Exhibitionistic disorder, sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature women F65.0 [302.81] Fetishistic Disorder In its original sense (it is derived from the Portuguese), a fetish was an idol or charm that had magical significance. In the context of sexual activity, it refers to something that excites an individual\u2019s sexual fantasies or desires. Such objects include underwear, shoes, stockings, and other inanimate objects. Bras and panties are probably the most common objects used as fetishes. The DSM-5 definition of fetishistic disorder also includes body parts that aren\u2019t integral to the reproductive process. A sexual attraction to feet would be an example of partialism , as this is known, which sometimes occurs along with other fetishes. (There Fetishistic Disorder 569 are reports of men who are attracted to women missing body parts, such as a one- legged woman\u2014a sort of fetishistic jamais vu .) Cross- dressing that is sexually exciting, as in transvestic disorder, and arousal achieved via objects designed for use during sex, such as dildos or vibrators, are excluded from the definition of fetishistic disorder. Some people amass collections of their preferred fetishes; some resort to stealing from stores or clotheslines to get them. They may smell, rub, or handle these objects while masturbating, or they may ask sex partners to wear them. Without a fetish, such a person may be unable to get an erection. Fetishism usually begins in adolescence, though many patients report similar interests even in childhood. Although some women may show a degree of fetishistic behavior, nearly all those with fetishistic disorder are men. It tends to be a chronic condition, to the extent that for some people, a fetish may come to crowd out",

Although some women may show a degree of fetishistic behavior, nearly all those with fetishistic disorder are men. It tends to be a chronic condition, to the extent that for some people, a fetish may come to crowd out more traditional love objects. Essential Features of Fetishistic Disorder The person is aroused by inanimate objects (such as shoes or underwear) or body parts other than genitals (such as feet) and feels distress/disability at the idea.

They were embroidered with flow- ers and the word \u201cSaturday,\u201d and he found them peculiarly exciting. He slept with them under his pillow for a couple of nights and masturbated with them twice before sneaking them back into his sister\u2019s bureau drawer Friday evening. From time to time 570 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS throughout the balance of his adolescence, when he was alone in the house, Corky would appropriate items of his sister\u2019s underwear. In college Corky lived alone, so he was able to collect and keep a small wardrobe of lingerie without concern that it would be discovered. Although he had a few bras and slips, he liked panties best. By his senior year, he owned several dozen. Some of these he had purchased, but he preferred those he could persuade a woman to leave behind after a date. He had even stolen one or two pairs from backyard clotheslines, but that was dangerous and he didn\u2019t do it often. Sometimes when Corky wasn\u2019t entertaining company, he would take some panties out of the drawer and play with them. He would smell them, rub them on his face, and masturbate with them. During these activities, he would pretend he was making love to the original owner of the panties. If he didn\u2019t know her, he would imagine what she might have looked like.

Corky was driven into treatment by the laughter of his most recent girlfriend when he found that he had to put her underwear under his pillow in order to get an erection when they were making love. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten totally fixated on panties,\u201d he said during his initial interview. \u201cI seem to prefer them to women.\u201d Evaluation of Corky Brauner Corky\u2019s excessive interest in panties is a typical example of fetishistic disorder. It had persisted for years\u2014far longer than the 6-month requirement (criterion A). Over the years, he had assembled quite a collection, obtained from a variety of sources. Corky\u2019s distress (B) stemmed not from his own perception of his behavior, but from the fact that a girlfriend criticized him for it. In this way, he learned that he preferred panties to people\u2014a not infrequent progression for fetishists. The differential diagnosis of fetishistic disorder includes transvestic disorder , in which men (almost always men) are stimulated by wearing and viewing themselves in women\u2019s clothing. Fetishists may put on clothing of the opposite sex, but wearing it is incidental to the sexual gratification they derive from the clothing itself, and they don\u2019t fantasize about their own attractiveness when so attired. Corky showed no interest in cross- dressing (C). Many fetishists have also been involved in rape, exhibitionism, frotteurism, pedo- philia, or voyeurism, but none of these behaviors are mentioned in Corky\u2019s vignette (his clinician should ask). Pending the outcome of such an inquiry, Corky\u2019s full diagnosis (with a GAF score of 61) would be as follows: F65.0 [302.81] Fetishistic disorder, nonliving objects (panties) F65.81 [302.89] Frotteuristic Disorder Frottage (the term is derived from the French word frotter , meaning \u201cto rub\u201d) usually takes place on crowded sidewalks or public transportation. (Ready means of escape is Frotteuristic Disorder 571 a concern for the frotteur.) The perpetrator (invariably a man) selects a victim (usually a woman) who is accessible and whose allure may be enhanced by tight clothing. The frotteur rubs his genitals against her thighs or buttocks, or he may fondle her breasts or genitalia. The process is efficient; on subways, ejaculation usually occurs within the transit time between stops. The victim typically does not make an immediate outcry, perhaps",

The process is efficient; on subways, ejaculation usually occurs within the transit time between stops. The victim typically does not make an immediate outcry, perhaps because she hopes she is mistaken about what appears to be happening. Note that it is the act of touching or rubbing, not the coercion involved, that is exciting to the frotteur. However, over half have a history of involvement in other paraphilias, especially exhibitionism and voyeurism. A frotteur often fantasizes about an ongoing intimate relationship with the victim. This condition usually begins in adolescence and is sometimes started off by observing others engaged in frottage. Most acts occur when the frotteur is between the ages of 15 and 25; frequency gradually declines thereafter. No one appears to know how common this condition is, and it may be underreported. Essential Features of Frotteuristic Disorder Aroused by rubbing against or feeling someone who hasn\u2019t consented, the patient has repeatedly acted on the urge (or feels distress/disability at the idea).

Dressed in his short gray pants, white shirt, and school tie, he rode the Underground every day to his exclusive school. One day, when he was 9, he saw a man rubbing up against a woman. Henry was small when he was 9, and even in the crowded subway car he had an excellent eye-level view. The woman (she was an adult, though Henry had no idea how 572 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS old) was a bit overweight and dressed in a tight- fitting miniskirt. She was facing away from the man, who allowed the weight of the crowd surging through the doors to press him up against her. The man tugged at his crotch, and then, as the train began to move, rubbed himself against her. \u201cI never saw her face, but I could tell she didn\u2019t like it,\u201d said Henry. \u201cShe tried to push him away, she tried to move, but there was no place for either of",

Then the train stopped and he ran out the door.\u201d Henry had moved with his parents to the United States when he was 15. Now age 24, he had referred himself for treatment with this story. Since his graduation from high school, he had worked as a messenger for a large legal firm. Many days he spent several hours on the subway in his official capacity. He guessed that he had rubbed against 200 women in 5 years. He was seeking help at the insistence of one of the partners in his law firm, who the week before had happened to ride the same train and had watched him in action. When Henry was in need, he would go into the men\u2019s room and put on a condom so as not to stain his trousers. Then he would roam up and down the outskirts of a crowd on a subway platform until he found a woman who interested him. This would be some- one who was youngish but not young (\u201cThey\u2019re less likely to scream\u201d), and well-rounded enough to stretch tight the material of her skirt or slacks. He especially liked it if the material was leather. He would board after she did, and if she did not turn around, would rub his erect penis up and down against her buttocks as the train began to roll. Henry was very sensitive, so it didn\u2019t take much pressure. Sometimes the woman didn\u2019t even seem to realize what was going on, or maybe she didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it, even to herself. He usually climaxed within a minute. Then he would bolt out the door at the next stop. If interrupted prior to climax, he would hang around the platform until he spotted another woman in another crowd. \u201cIt helps if I imagine that we\u2019re married or engaged,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ll pretend that she\u2019s wearing my ring, and I\u2019ve come home for a quickie.\u201d Evaluation of Henry McWilliams Henry\u2019s method of operation was fairly typical for frotteurs, most of whom tend to fol - low the same pattern each",

Henry had offended on many occasions (criteria A, B). Like most, he had had many episodes of this behavior over the years and fantasized having a romance with each victim. Henry was not especially upset about his own behavior; he came for treatment because his employers demanded it. Although patients with schizophrenia or intellectual disability will sometimes engage in sexual behavior that is inappropriate to the context, Henry bore no evidence whatsoever of either condition. With a GAF score of 70, his diagnosis would simply be this: F65.81 [302.89] Frotteuristic disorder Frotteuristic Disorder 573 F65.4 [302.2] Pedophilic Disorder Pedophilia is Greek meaning \u201clove of children.\u201d In the context of a paraphilia, of course, it means sex with children. Pedophilic disorder is far and away the most common of the paraphilic disorders that involve actual contact. Estimates vary, but by the age of 18, up to 20% of American children have in some way been interfered with sexually. Most perpetrators are not strangers but relatives, friends, or neighbors. The vast majority of pedophiles are men, but women may account for up to 12% of recorded offenses (though some of these involve allowing children to be abused, rather than committing the act personally). The type of act preferred varies with the offender. Some pedophiles only view (child pornography or actual children); others want to touch or undress a child. But most acts involve oral sex or touching of the child\u2019s genitals\u2014or of the perpetrator\u2019s genitals by the child. In cases other than incest, most pedophiles don\u2019t require actual penetration. Those who do, however, may use force to achieve it. Though some pedophiles do not start until midlife, this behavior usually begins in later teenage years. (The definition of pedophilic disorder specifically excludes perpe - trators who are adolescents themselves or who aren\u2019t at least 5 years older than the vic- tim.) It may be more common among persons who were themselves abused as children. Once pedophilia has begun, it tends to be chronic. Up to 50% use alcohol as a prelude to contact with children. Half or more have other paraphilias.",
    "aren\u2019t at least 5 years older than the vic- tim.) It may be more common among persons who were themselves abused as children. Once pedophilia has begun, it tends to be chronic. Up to 50% use alcohol as a prelude to contact with children. Half or more have other paraphilias. Many pedophiles limit themselves to children (this type of pedophilia is called exclusive); they often further confine themselves to children of a particular sex and age range. However, the majority are also attracted to adults, and their pedophilia is called nonexclusive. Like other paraphilic individuals, pedophiles may develop a degree of cognitive distortion about their activities: They persuade themselves that children enjoy the sexual experience or that it is important for their development. Most pedophiles do not force their attentions on children, but depend on friendship, persuasion, and guile. A number of studies suggest that children who are lonely or otherwise uncared for may be especially susceptible to the advances of a pedophile. Overall, perhaps 15\u201325% of those convicted reoffend within a few years of their release from prison. Alcohol use and trouble forming intimate relationships with adults increase the chances of recidivism. Men who prefer boys are about twice as likely to reoffend as are those who prefer girls. Some pedophiles limit their attentions to daughters, stepdaughters, or other vic - tims related to them. Then the specifier limited to incest can be used, though it isn\u2019t clear what benefit it confers. Some perpetrators of incest may be pedophiles, but many men (most incestuous adults are male) only become interested in daughters or step - daughters who have reached puberty. collateral information is especially important in evaluating pedophiles, who have strong reasons to lie about their behavior. a nd often there\u2019s little motivation to tell the truth: Sentences are long; convicted pedophiles may face harsh treatment in prison; and the 574 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS prospect of suppressing sex interest through the use of drugs is unappealing to many such people. One aspect of the criteria that can be confusing is the required 5-year age difference between perpetrator and victim. a s the c oding n otes indicate, a 15-year-old having a sexual relationship with someone of any age would not be diagnosed as having pedophilic disorder. Someone who is 20 having an affair with a 14- or 15-year-old, however, would. and that raises another difficult issue. according to DSM-5 criteria,",

Someone who is 20 having an affair with a 14- or 15-year-old, however, would. and that raises another difficult issue. according to DSM-5 criteria, the child involved must be prepubescent. If we interpret strictly what DSM-5 says, we won\u2019t be making the diagnosis in someone whose victim has begun to develop sexually. This has caused a lot of heartburn among clinicians as well as some members of the relevant DSM-5 commit - tee, who worry that by maintaining the current definition DSM-5 depathologizes men who prefer certain children 13 and under who are not prepubertal.

Of course, it also is the only one that doesn\u2019t allow in full remission, but that is at least logical: pedophilia has been long established as a lifelong condition. However, who is more likely to do hard time than a pedophile? and just how likely is that person to reoffend while inside?

    "seemed an unlikely convict. His orange prison jumpsuit was stretched tightly over his pear- shaped body; in contrast to the swagger of the younger inmates, he shuffled, head down, along the corridor to the interview room. Raymond had become interested in sex when he was very young. One of his ear - liest memories was of sex play with a teenage girl who was babysitting him and his infant sister. As an adult, the sight of little girls\u2019 bodies particularly fascinated him. He remembered watching his sister having her bath when he was 7 or 8, hanging around until his mother had to shoo him from the bathroom. When they were teenagers, he had watched outside his sister\u2019s window at night, trying to get a glimpse of her as she undressed for bed. When she entered puberty, his evening vigils stopped. \u201cIt was the body hair. It seemed so coarse and disgusting. That was when I discovered that I only really liked girls who were, um, smooth.\u201d Despite these tastes, in his mid-20s Raymond married the daughter of the fore - man in the printing shop where he worked. During the early years of their marriage, the couple maintained an active sex life. Usually he would try to fantasize that he was having sex with a young girl. Once he persuaded his wife to shave off all her pubic hair, but she complained that it itched as it grew back and refused to do it again. They had three children, all sons, which in retrospect seemed a minor miracle: Little boys didn\u2019t tempt him at all. As the years went by, Raymond acquired a small stack of pornographic magazines that featured children. He kept them hidden under a pile of rags in his tool shed. When his sexual tension became too high, he would masturbate while he imagined himself frolicking with the naked children in these pictures. By his early 50s, Raymond\u2019s life had taken a turn for the worse. His sons had all left home, and a series of pelvic operations caused his wife to reject his sexual advances, sometimes for months at a time. To fill his time, he took up photography. Especially over the long summer months, he found ready subjects in the neighborhood children he befriended. Some of the little girls he could persuade to pose partly or completely disrobed.

Some of the little girls he could persuade to pose partly or completely disrobed. He preferred those who were 5 or 6 years old, but on occasion he would pho - tograph a girl as old as 8. (The older children were more independent and harder to 576 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS persuade.) These sessions occurred principally in a secluded spot behind his tool shed. He used candy and quarters as bait, afterwards reminding each child that her parents wouldn\u2019t like it if she told. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it,\u201d he said as he tried to ease the bulging waistband of his jump- suit. \u201cIt was just something I couldn\u2019t resist. The feeling I\u2019d get when she\u2019d slip down her panties\u2014it was anxiety and ecstasy and butterflies in my stomach. Sort of the way you\u2019d feel if you won the lottery. But I never touched one; all I did was look. And I never thought it might hurt them any.\u201d Raymond had been looking and taking pictures for the better part of 10 years when he was discovered by a 12-year-old boy who had ventured behind the tool shed to col- lect native plant specimens for a science exhibit. The boy told his father, who called the girl\u2019s mother, who called the police. The trial\u2014a 3-week media feeding frenzy\u2014 featured the corroborative testimony of no fewer than seven neighborhood girls, now in varying stages of adolescence, who had at one time or another been victimized by Raymond Boggs. Sentenced to 5\u201310 years in the penitentiary, Raymond still faced millions of dollars in civil lawsuits. The day after he was arrested, his wife filed for divorce and entered therapy. One of his sons broke off contact with him; another moved out of state. Evaluation of Raymond Boggs When the facts of the case are clear, there is little to dispute the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder. Someone with substance intoxication may perpetrate an isolated incident of fondling a child, but then it is usually evident that this is not a frequent sexual outlet. As an example of their overall defective judgment, patients with intellectual disability or schizophrenia may sometimes fall into this mode of sexual release.

    "incident of fondling a child, but then it is usually evident that this is not a frequent sexual outlet. As an example of their overall defective judgment, patients with intellectual disability or schizophrenia may sometimes fall into this mode of sexual release. Parents (notoriously celebrities) are sometimes accused of child molestation as a part of a messy divorce; frequently the facts do not bear out these allegations. In the case of Raymond Boggs, the legal facts were indisputable. He freely admitted to his long- standing interests and behavior (criteria A, B). He insisted that the act was never tactile, only visual, which is typical of a large number of such people. Those with exhibitionistic disorder may show themselves to children, but they don\u2019t approach the victims for further sexual activity. Some pedophiles may also have sexual sadism disorder; if so, both diagnoses should be made. We are asked to choose several specifiers to help pinpoint the patient\u2019s pathology. Raymond was sexually attracted only to females, and young ones at that. His GAF score would be 55. Even though the criteria for pedophilic disorder don\u2019t offer the specifier in a controlled environment , I\u2019ve sneaked in a mention of it anyway. F65.4 [302.2] Pedophilic disorder, nonexclusive type, sexually attracted to females, in a controlled environment Z65.1[V62.5] Imprisonment Pedophilic Disorder 577 F65.51 [302.83] Sexual Masochism Disorder Sexual masochism comprises three principal features: pain, humiliation, and absence of control. Many people\u2014 perhaps 15% of the general population\u2014derive sexual plea- sure from some degree of suffering. However, these behaviors/ideas by themselves are usually benign, and are certainly insufficient for the diagnosis of a disorder. Indeed, most people who engage in masochistic behavior function well, both socially and psychologically. Some women even admit that they like being spanked during sex or that they fantasize about being forced to have sex. Sexual masochism is thus the only paraphilic behavior in which any appreciable number of women appear to participate. On the other hand, sexual masochism disorder (SMD) is a paraphilic disorder that usually begins in childhood. The behaviors involved include bondage, blindfolding, spanking, cutting, and humiliation (by defecation, urination, or forcing the submis - sive partner to imitate an animal). Some form of physical abuse is probably the most commonly used. As time goes on, patients with SMD may require increasing degrees of torture to experience the same degree of sexual satisfaction; in this sense, SMD",
    "(by defecation, urination, or forcing the submis - sive partner to imitate an animal). Some form of physical abuse is probably the most commonly used. As time goes on, patients with SMD may require increasing degrees of torture to experience the same degree of sexual satisfaction; in this sense, SMD resembles an addiction. By choking, pricking, or shocking, some masochists inflict pain upon themselves. Perhaps 30% of them at times also participate in sadistic behavior. A few pursue an especially dangerous behavior called asphyxiophilia (or hypoxyphilia) , in which they induce near- suffocation by means of a noose around the neck, an airtight bag over the head, or the inhalation of amyl nitrite (\u201cpoppers\u201d). These people report that the sensation of restricted breathing promotes an especially intense sexual high. Each year, 1 or 2 accidental deaths per 1 million of the general population occur from these practices. Although masochists derive sexual gratification from feeling pain or degradation, they do not necessarily surrender complete control. Many sadomasochistic relation - ships are carefully planned; the partners may agree upon a secret word by which the masochist can indicate that it really is time to stop. Essential Features of Sexual Masochism Disorder The patient is sexually aroused by being struck, restrained, or otherwise made to feel humiliated (and feels distress/disability at the idea).

In the apart - ment he shared with Samuel Brock, the two had devised an elaborate contraption of pulleys, ropes, collars, and shackles that could turn Martin upside down and partly strangle him while Sam applied the whip. \u201cI get the most beautiful orgasm when I\u2019m about to pass out,\u201d Martin reported, much later.

The two were fighting on the deserted playground, and Sam began sitting on Martin, twisting his fingers into pretzels. Although Martin cried, the growing urgency of his erection was evident as the pain increased. After they parted, Sam had masturbated while recalling the sensation of absolute control. Without discussing it much, by common consent Sam and Martin met again 2 weeks later. When they were 19, they moved in together, and they had been living together ever since. Now they were 28. Martin didn\u2019t have to be hurt to enjoy sex, but it greatly enhanced the pleasure. He had tried spanking and bondage, but asphyxia was the best. When he was younger, he had played the field and tried other partners. But most of them had hurt him either too much or not enough; besides, he and Sam were both afraid of AIDS. For the last several years, they had worked at the same department store and had been faithful to one other. The night of the accident, Martin got himself into the harness while Sam was at work. He apparently cinched the noose a shade too tight and lost consciousness, though he didn\u2019t remember that. When Sam found Martin, he had no pulse and wasn\u2019t breath- ing. In the Boy Scouts, Sam had learned CPR, which he vigorously employed after calling 911. A police report was made, and a pair of officers interviewed them both. \u201cWe\u2019re per- fectly suited,\u201d Sam explained. \u201cI like to do it; he likes it done.\u201d He admitted that their sex life had recently become increasingly violent, even death- defying. But that hadn\u2019t been his idea; it was Martin who had needed more to produce the same effects. Sam admitted that he \u201cgot off\u201d on pain, but some pain seemed to serve about as well as a lot. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to really harm him,\u201d he said. \u201cI love him.\u201d Sexual Masochism Disorder 579 Evaluation of Martin Allingham Martin\u2019s sexual behavior included elements of pain inflicted upon himself (criterion A).

Martin had acted on these urges for years; the impairment it had recently caused was nearly terminal (B). He therefore amply fulfilled the criteria for SMD. Note that some sex workers accept pain within limits, because the pay is better than that for standard sex. Such individuals should not be diagnosed as having SMD unless they also both derive pleasure from the practice and are distressed or impaired by it. Masochists will sometimes cross-dress in response to the demands of a sadistic partner. If the act of wearing clothing of the opposite gender also produces sexual excite- ment (and not just the humiliation of cross- dressing), then transvestic disorder should also be diagnosed. The vignette is silent on the issue, but Martin\u2019s clinician should thor- oughly explore the possibility of a personality disorder\u2014common among patients with SMD\u2014which could significantly affect therapy. Mention it in the summary. Consider- ing the fact that sexual arousal was augmented by the sensation of restricted breathing, Martin\u2019s diagnosis (current GAF score of 25) would be as follows: F65.51 [302.83] Sexual masochism disorder, with asphyxiophilia F65.52 [302.84] Sexual Sadism Disorder Much of the behavior of sadists complements that of masochists; the difference is that sadists are the perpetrators rather than the recipients. Inflicting pain or humiliation sexually stimulates them. The suffering of others arouses them sexually, and they fan - tasize about dominance and restraint. Some women admit to engaging in this sort of activity. Although early childhood experiences with punishment may prefigure this chronic condition for some, overt behavior usually begins with fantasies during the individual\u2019s teenage years. The physical methods ultimately employed include bondage, blindfold- ing, spanking, cutting, and humiliation (such as by defecation, urination, or forcing the submissive partner to imitate an animal). Like those with sexual masochism, individu - als with sexual sadism may with time need to increase the severity of the torture to produce the same degree of sexual satisfaction. Most people who engage in sadistic behavior limit themselves to only a few part - ners, most of whom are willing; by definition, these people would not meet DSM-5 criteria for sexual sadism disorder unless they were distressed or impaired by their urges.

Fewer than 10% of sadists commit rape, but those who do can be even more brutal than other rapists, using more force and inflicting greater pain than is necessary to fulfill their needs. We don\u2019t know the frequency of sexual sadism disorder in the general population. 580 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS In a study of 240 hospitalized sexual offenders, 52 (21%) could be diagnosed as having sexual sadism disorder.

It is both interesting and instructive to explore the degree to which the personal history of this man, who flourished over two centuries ago in France, reflects the condition that bears his name. Sade (as his biographers call him) was born into a family that was poor but socially prominent, which may help explain his development into a proud, arrogant autocrat. An absent father left the nurturing during his early formative years to his libertine uncle. When he was only 16, Sade entered the army and served with distinction in com- bat. Forced by his family into a loveless (on his part) marriage, soon after the wedding he demonstrated that his sexual interests could be problematic. As a child he had yearned for his mother\u2019s embrace, but as an adult he sought sol- ace in the arms of prostitutes. Several of those he hired filed formal complaints that he had tried to whip them; one also claimed he had made her ill by spiking her bourbon",
    "As a child he had yearned for his mother\u2019s embrace, but as an adult he sought sol- ace in the arms of prostitutes. Several of those he hired filed formal complaints that he had tried to whip them; one also claimed he had made her ill by spiking her bourbon with the notorious (and overhyped) aphrodisiac, Spanish fly. He asked many of the prostitutes he frequented to whip him\u2014not so unusual a request among 18th- century Frenchmen, who were known sometimes to address impotence by employing the lash. Sexual Sadism Disorder 581 In prison, he later used huge rectal dildos (which he required his wife, Ren\u00e9e, to pro - cure for him) to gain sexual satisfaction. What assured his ultimate downfall was neither his passion nor his penury, but the antipathy of his mother-in-law. Cette dame formidable reacted to his libertine ten- dencies by persuading the King to issue a private bill of attainder then popular among French petitioners. It allowed the authorities to toss Sade into prison and hold him without trial, without end. In confinement\u2014he spent nearly 29 years either in prison or in the asylum at Cha- renton, and he came within 1 day of execution during the Terror of the French Revo - lution\u2014he wrote some of the most sexually explicit and violent prose ever composed in any language. Justine relates the sexual torture of a young woman at the hands of various men, beginning when she was 12 years old. The 120 Days of Sodom, written down in little more than a month while he languished in the Bastille, is a nauseating (pardon the editorial queasy stomach) crescendo of sexual horror that culminates in murder. It is on his writings, rather than his own sexual proclivities, that his reputation rests. That reputation notwithstanding, Sade\u2019s character, at least at this remove, remains to a degree confusing. On the one hand, some regard him as an angry loner with a quick and violent temper who had no true friends. Others describe him as a lifelong charmer who could easily manipulate people, sometimes with threats of suicide. He was later to develop frequent ideas of persecution that involved Ren\u00e9e. He scrutinized her letters for hidden signals, which he thought contained references to his release date.

Yet, during one of his infrequent releases from prison, when he could have exacted revenge on his in-laws, he didn\u2019t. His reward was rearrest and incarceration for the rest of his life. Evaluation of Donatien Alphonse Fran\u00e7ois, the Marquis de Sade From his own writings and from the work of others, it is clear that Sade was intensely interested in sexual pleasures derived from inflicting pain and humiliation on other people (criterion A). Although he did not appear to suffer distress from these desires, he acted upon them repeatedly with nonconsenting individuals when he was quite a young man (B). That qualifies him, even by today\u2019s robust standards, for the diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder. (We cannot doubt that the characters described in Sade\u2019s The 120 Days of Sodom would more than fully qualify for this diagnosis.) Yet, when we consider the entirety of his life, Sade even better fulfills the defini - tion of sexual masochism disorder: He was much given to receiving the pain of whip - pings, which contributed to his prolonged incarceration. Yet the power of tradition is such that his name remains firmly attached to behavior that he appears to have pursued personally during a relatively brief chapter in his career. What other diagnosis might be appropriate? Of course, for anyone with his incli - nations we would consider a personality disorder , but it would be in addition to, not instead of, the paraphilic disorder diagnosis. Mention of it belongs in a summary. 582 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS With only the information given above, the Marquis de Sade\u2019s diagnoses (in order of appearance) would read as given below.

This led to the adaptation of his name (along with Sade\u2019s) for their respective paraphilias in the 1886 textbook Psychopathia Sexualis by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, whose name, sadly, has not been attached to anything. Sade and Sacher- Masoch are among the diminishing ranks of individuals whose names are retained as eponyms in DSM-5. a nd they are the only ones we use as adjec- tives\u2014as is also the case with the terms Freudian and Jungian . Disorders using other personal names, such as M\u00fcnchausen\u2019s syndrome, have been rebranded with terms that are more descriptive (though perhaps less evocative). F65.1 [302.3] Transvestic Disorder Transvestites cross-dress to achieve sexual excitement; they experience frustration when this behavior is thwarted. There is much variability in the amount of cross- dressing. Some will do it occasionally, while alone; others frequently sally forth in public. Some limit it to underwear; others get completely togged out. Some men (once again, men vastly predominate) spend up to several hours a week getting dressed in and wearing women\u2019s clothing. Many will masturbate or have intercourse when they cross-dress. They may fantasize about themselves as girls and keep a collection of female cloth - ing, often wearing it under normal male attire. But only a person who is distressed or impaired in some important way by the pursuit of these behaviors earns the diagnosis of transvestic disorder; those who embrace their own behavior are simply cross- dressers. Transvestic disorder usually begins during adolescence, or even in childhood. However, most male transvestites were not effeminate as boys; under 20% of them are gay as adults. As happens with some other paraphilias, their aberrant behavior may gradually replace more usual modes of sexual gratification. Through videos, magazines, or personal interaction, there may be considerable involvement in the transvestite sub- culture. A small number gradually come to feel increasingly comfortable with their cross- dressing and become transsexual. Such gender dysphoria may provide the final stimulus to seek treatment. With age, the sexual excitement attached to cross- dressing may give way to a general sense of well-being. Some patients have been previously involved in voyeuristic, exhibitionistic, or mas- Transvestic Disorder 583 ochistic behaviors.

At first Paul only tolerated this, but later he would become excited at the sensation of her silky panties as he drew them up over his skinny thighs. When Julie acquired a steady boyfriend and lost interest in Paul, he would some - times covertly borrow a bra and panties from his mother to dress up in. By his late teens, he had collected a small wardrobe of women\u2019s underwear, which he would put on as often as once or twice a week. Standing in front of a mirror wearing a bra, its cups attractively padded, he might fantasize himself being embraced\u2014 sometimes by a man, sometimes a woman. A time or two he tried on lipstick and an old dress his mother hardly ever wore. But those made him look silly and conspicuous, he thought, and he 584 PArAPHILIC DISOrDErS subsequently limited himself to lingerie. However, he never felt any sense of discomfort about being male or any desire to change his gender. After a year of junior college, Paul",

However, he never felt any sense of discomfort about being male or any desire to change his gender. After a year of junior college, Paul got a job as a clerk in a bookstore and moved to his own apartment. Some days he would wear his panties and bra (without the padding) to work under his sport shirt and slacks. Then, during lunch hour, he might masturbate in the men\u2019s room as he imagined himself making love to a beautiful woman, both of them dressed in their silk underwear. If he was otherwise occupied during lunch, throughout the afternoon he would enjoy the delicious sensation of silk next to his skin and the anticipation of release while looking at himself in the mirror that evening. Paul was thus attired one morning when the paramedics picked him up after a passing bus clipped him on his way to work. He awakened to find his right upper arm in a splint, and passers-by agog over his size 40C Maidenform bra. His shame over this episode caused him to rethink his behavior and seek treatment. Evaluation of Paul Castro Western society tolerates some cross- dressing and even considers it normal. Transgen- der impersonation has had a long and honorable history on the stage and in film; Hal - loween apparel also comes to mind. In sexual masochistic disorder , patients may be forced to cross-dress to excite a sadistic lover; if they do not also experience sexual excitement, transvestic disorder would not be diagnosed. Patients with gender dysphoria often dress in clothing appro- priate to the opposite sex, but without sexual stimulation. When gay people cross-dress, it is sometimes done to enhance their appeal to other gay individuals; often, however, it is done to be campy or to make fun of society. In any event, sexual stimulation is not the goal. Obviously, Paul\u2019s behavior fit none of these alternative explanations. In fact, other than his interest in lingerie, he had fairly conventional heterosexual interests (judged by his fantasies when masturbating; criterion A). He therefore would not receive the specifier with autogynephilia. He appeared to be aroused by the feel of silk, so we could justify giving him the with fetishism specifier. His ultimate distress (GAF score of 71)",

His ultimate distress (GAF score of 71) when he was picked up by the paramedics would fulfill criterion B. F65.1 [302.3] Transvestic disorder, with fetishism S42.009 [810.00] Fractured clavicle Women can now be diagnosed as having transvestic disorder. This was not the case in DSM-IV-TR or in any of its predecessors, back to DSM-III. The change is egalitarian in the extreme: The only study reporting any women seeking sexual stimulation from cross- dressing found just 5 of 1,171 (0.4%), and we don\u2019t know whether those few had been dis- tressed or impaired by their behavior. In practical terms, this club remains \u201cfor men only.\u201d Transvestic Disorder 585 F65.3 [302.82] Voyeuristic Disorder Voyeurs are aroused by watching people engaged in private activities. Of course, many people who do not have a paraphilia also enjoy such viewing\u2014those who patronize por- nographic films and websites, for example. The difference is that a voyeur\u2019s gratification derives from viewing ordinary people who do not realize they are being watched and would probably not permit it if they did. In a 2006 Swedish survey, 12% of men (and 4% of women) admitted to at least one incident of voyeuristic behavior. By current standards, the vast majority of these individuals would not be diagnosed with a paraphilic disorder. Other surveys find that many people of both sexes would watch others undressing or having sex if they felt they wouldn\u2019t be caught. As with other paraphilic disorders, DSM-5 requires that the behavior be acted upon repeatedly or cause the individual distress or impairment. The bottom lines: Nearly all practitioners are men, and voyeurism is the most commonly reported sexual crime. Voyeurism usually begins when individuals are in their teens\u2014almost always by age 15. Once voyeuristic disorder develops, it tends to be chronic. The victims of these \u201cpeeping Toms\u201d are almost always strangers. Voyeurs will usually masturbate while they are watching. Afterwards, they may fantasize about having sex with the victim, though activity with that victim is rarely sought. Some voyeurs prefer this method of sexual gratification, but most also have normal sex lives. Like exhibitionists, they take precautions to avoid detection. Essential Features of Voyeuristic",

Some voyeurs prefer this method of sexual gratification, but most also have normal sex lives. Like exhibitionists, they take precautions to avoid detection. Essential Features of Voyeuristic Disorder Aroused by watching an unwary person who is undressing or having sex, the patient has repeatedly acted on these urges or has experienced distress or impairment from them.

This time, at age 23, Rex had been caught literally with his pants down, masturbating outside the master bedroom window of a house on a quiet suburban street. He had been so fascinated by the aspect of the woman inside removing her underwear that he failed to notice the approach of her husband, who was walking the dog. When Rex was growing up, his family had lived near the campus of a small Mid - western college. He had made friends with the caretaker at the student union\u2014a gan - gly philosophy major named Rollo who, in exchange for minor custodial work, lived rent-free in a room on the second floor. When Rex was 14, Rollo showed him the tiny hole he had discovered in the floorboards immediately above the women\u2019s toilet. Inter- mittently for some weeks, Rex and Rollo had squatted in the dark above the peephole, waiting for women to enter. Because they were looking straight down, they couldn\u2019t see much, but the images provided plenty of grist for the mill of Rex\u2019s fantasy life. When he graduated from high school, Rex went to work in an auto body shop. The bookkeeper, Darlene, was a year or two older than he, and they soon began living together. Rex and Darlene made love four or five times a week; they each expressed sat- isfaction with the arrangement. Rex sometimes wondered whether he",
    "Rex went to work in an auto body shop. The bookkeeper, Darlene, was a year or two older than he, and they soon began living together. Rex and Darlene made love four or five times a week; they each expressed sat- isfaction with the arrangement. Rex sometimes wondered whether he was \u201coversexed\u201d because he still occasionally had the urge to \u201cgo looking.\u201d He had tried X-rated videos, but it wasn\u2019t the same\u2014those people knew they were being watched, and they were also being paid. So every 2 or 3 months Rex would spend a couple of evenings driving on dark, quiet streets, seeking the right venue. Catching a glimpse of naked flesh was titillating, but watching a woman undressing added the delicious suspense of not knowing how much would be revealed. Whatever he saw, Rex would add to the stock of images to conjure up when he made love with Darlene. Best of all was watching people have sex. He had carefully memorized the loca - tions of several such encounters, and he returned to them again and again when the urge struck. Summertime was best, for then people were less likely to get under the covers. He had once or twice stood in the bushes for as long as 2 hours, watching while his targets worked up their passion and his. That was what had drawn him back to the house where he was apprehended\u2014less than four blocks from where he\u2019d been arrested a year before. \u201cI suppose I should feel ashamed,\u201d Rex told the interviewer, \u201cbut I\u2019m not. I think it\u2019s normal to be interested. And if they really cared about their privacy, they\u2019d close their curtains, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Evaluation of Rex Collingwood There isn\u2019t much of a differential diagnosis in a history like Rex\u2019s; he easily fulfills crite- ria A and B. If he had spent his time watching paid performers on a stage or the Internet, Voyeuristic Disorder 587 we wouldn\u2019t think a thing about it; neither would the judge. Although Rex had acted repeatedly on his urges, the only distress he felt was at the prospect of being punished. With a GAF score of 61, Rex\u2019s complete diagnosis would be as follows: F65.3 [302.82] Voyeuristic disorder Z65.3 [V62.5] Arrest and prosecution F65.89 [302.89] Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder A variety of other paraphilic disorders have been described.

As compared to the forego- ing disorders, most of these are less common, less well studied, or both. Coded as other specified paraphilic disorder, they include the following: Paraphilic coercive disorder. An individual enjoys the idea of forcing sex upon an unwilling partner. Telephone scatologia. As the name implies, this is a preoccupation with \u201ctalking dirty\u201d on the phone. It has been found to be associated with exhibitionism and voyeurism. Zoophilia. This paraphilia is a preoccupation with having sex with various mam - mals and other animals. Uncommon in clinical samples, these individuals often report that the attraction is not just sex, but a love for animals. Necrophilia. Sex with corpses was said to be the only release undertakers had in ancient Egypt. Sex with contemporary cadavers, rarely reported, almost demands another mental or personality diagnosis (perhaps both). Klismaphilia. In this paraphilia, somewhat allied to sexual masochistic disorder, some people achieve sexual pleasure by giving themselves enemas. In some such individuals, klismaphilia is linked with cross- dressing. Though it may be fairly common, this behavior has been little studied in the professional literature. Coprophilia. This is masturbating with one\u2019s own feces; it has been rarely reported. Urophilia. Some people become sexually excited by playing or masturbating with urine. This must be distinguished from the form of sexual masochism in which the person desires to be urinated upon (\u201cgolden showers\u201d). Collectively, preoccupa - tions with enemas and urine are termed \u201cwater sports\u201d by those who enjoy them. Infantilism. In this paraphilia, the patient derives sexual satisfaction from being treated like a baby\u2014 perhaps wearing diapers and drinking from a bottle.

    "19 Other Factors That May Need Clinical Attention You can use the codes provided in this chapter to report certain environmental or other physical or psychosocial events or conditions that might affect the diagnosis or manage- ment of your patient. When stating them, be as specific as possible. (Other problems are possible; these are samples.) Many of these were listed on Axis IV of DSM-IV. DSM-5 requires that we use ICD-10 [or ICD-9] codes for the problems we identify. Following is a reasonably complete list of those available. But remember, please, that these behaviors, conditions, and relationships are not mental disorders. I emphasize this point in the attempt to reduce our tendency to carve pathology out of behavior that is, after all, the stuff of normal human existence. relational and Family Problems Z62.820 [V61.20] Parent\u2013Child Relational Problem Use parent\u2013child relational problem when clinically important symptoms or negative effects on functioning are associated with the way a parent and child interact. The prob- lematic interaction patterns may include faulty communication, ineffective discipline, or overprotection. Various emotional and behavioral problems could ensue. Z63.0 [V61.10] Relationship Distress with Spouse or Intimate Partner Use relationship distress with spouse or intimate partner when clinically important symptoms or negative effects on functioning are associated with the way a patient and spouse/partner interact. The problematic interaction patterns may include faulty com- munication or an absence of communication. However, this category explicitly excludes problems related to abuse (which are described below). Z62.891 [V61.8] Sibling Relational Problem Use sibling relational problem when clinically important symptoms or negative effects on functioning are associated with the way siblings interact. Z62.898 [V61.29] Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress Z62.29 [V61.8] Upbringing Away from Parents Upbringing away from parents is for problems that arise because a child is living in foster care or with relatives or friends, but not in residential care or boarding school. Z59.3 [V60.6] Problems Related to Living in a Residential Institution This code is for use with kids (or adults) whose problems arise from living away from home in some sort of institution.

Z63.4 [V62.82] Uncomplicated Bereavement When a relative or close friend dies, it is natural to grieve. When the symptoms of the grieving process are a reason for receiving clinical attention, DSM-5 allows us to code these as uncomplicated bereavement\u2014 provided that the symptoms don\u2019t last too long and aren\u2019t too severe. The problem is that the sadness of grief can resemble the sadness associated with a major depressive episode. Certain symptoms can help you decide whether, in addition to being bereaved, the patient is suffering from a major depressive episode: \u2022\u2022 Guilt feelings (other than about actions that might have prevented the death) \u2022\u2022 Death wishes (other than the survivor\u2019s wishing to have died with the loved one) \u2022\u2022 Slowed-down psychomotor activity 590 OTHEr FACTOrS THAT MAY NEED CLINICAL ATTENTION \u2022\u2022 Severe preoccupation with worthlessness \u2022\u2022 Severely impaired functioning for an unusually long time \u2022\u2022 Hallucinations (other than of seeing or hearing the deceased) In addition, people who are \u201conly\u201d bereaved typically regard their moods as nor - mal. Traditionally, a diagnosis of depressive illness has been withheld in these cases until after the symptoms have lasted longer than 2 months. Now we are encouraged to diagnose major depressive disorder regardless of bereavement, should the symptoms warrant. Table 19.1 compares the symptoms of major depression with those of uncom- plicated bereavement. Academic and Occupational Problems Z55.9 [V62.3] Academic or Educational Problem Use academic or educational problem for a patient whose problem is related to scho - lastic endeavors and who does not have a specific learning disorder or other mental disorder that accounts for the problem. Examples include illiteracy, unavailable school, poor academic performance, underachievement, or discord with teacher or other stu - dents. Even if another disorder can account for the problem, the academic problem itself may be so severe that it independently justifies clinical attention. For example, see the vignette of Colin Rodebaugh (p. 311). TABLE 19.1.

Z91.19 [V15.81] Nonadherence to Medical Treatment Use nonadherence to medical treatment for a patient who requires attention because the patient has ignored or controverted attempts at treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition. An example would be a patient with schizophrenia who requires repeated hospitalization for refusal to take medication. Z91.83 [V40.31] Wandering Associated with a Mental Disorder The wandering . . . code applies especially to patients with major neurocognitive disor- ders, who are particularly prone to leaving their dwellings and striking off on their own; the negative consequences sometimes make national headlines.

Z91.5 [V15.59] Personal History of Self-Harm Problems related to Abuse or Neglect The titles of the Z-codes [with V-codes] for various types of abuse or neglect are pretty much self- explanatory. Rather than write out every one of them, I\u2019ve put them into a table (see Table 19.2). Also, each of the ICD-10 codes in Table 19.2 should have XA (for initial encounter) or XD (for subsequent encounter) appended. Note that some of the code numbers are the same, though the wording is different. This isn\u2019t a mistake\u2014or, at least, it isn\u2019t my mistake. Here are three helpful definitions: Sexual abuse. Any sex act (including those that do not involve contact,",

This isn\u2019t a mistake\u2014or, at least, it isn\u2019t my mistake. Here are three helpful definitions: Sexual abuse.

Examples include berating, scapegoating, threaten - ing, coercion, and physical confinement. By the way, there are other codes you can use if the focus of the interview is on the encounter for mental health services for the victim or the perpetrator\u2014 different codes if the perpetrator is a parent or not (see Table 19.3). And if the patient has a personal history of abuse or neglect, there are some codes for that, too (see Table 19.4). TABLE 19.2.

Examples include severe hypotension caused by neuroleptics and priapism caused by trazodone.

R41.83 [V62.89] Borderline Intellectual Functioning Use borderline intellectual functioning for a patient whose IQ and level of functioning fall within the range of approximately 71\u201384. In the face of other mental diagnoses (psychotic or cognitive disorders, for example), the differential diagnosis between bor- derline intellectual functioning and mild intellectual disability can be quite difficult\u2014 especially now that DSM-5 has stopped defining intellectual disability by IQ score. Z60.0 [V62.89] Phase of Life Problem Use phase of life problem for a patient whose problem is not due to a mental disorder but to a life change, such as marriage, divorce, a new job, an empty nest, or retirement. It must be discriminated from adjustment disorder. Z60.3 [V62.4] Acculturation Problem Acculturation problem may be useful for patients whose problems center on a move from one culture to another (e.g., migrants and immigrants). Z60.4 [V62.4] Social Exclusion or Rejection Being a victim of bullying would fit in here.

Z65.8 [V62.89] Other Problem Related to Psychosocial Circumstances This catch-all category could include death or illness of a relative, or remarriage of a parent. I realize that it has the same code numbers as religious or spiritual problem; life\u2019s imperfect. 598 O THER FACTORS THAT MAY NEED CLINICAL ATTENTION Z65.5 [V62.22] Exposure to Disaster, War, or Other Hostilities Z72.9 [V69.9] Problem Related to Lifestyle Examples include poor sleep hygiene, high-risk sexual behavior. Z76.5 [V65.2] Malingering Malingering is defined as the intentional production of the signs or symptoms of a phys- ical or mental disorder. The purpose is some sort of gain: obtaining something desirable (money, drugs, insurance settlement) or avoiding something unpleasant (punishment, work, military service, jury duty). Malingering is often confused with factitious disor - der (in which the motive is not external gain, but a wish to occupy the sick role) and other somatic symptom and related disorders (in which the symptoms are not intention- ally produced at all). Malingering should be suspected in any of these situations: \u2022\u2022 The patient has legal problems or the prospect of financial gain. \u2022\u2022 The patient has antisocial personality disorder. \u2022\u2022 The patient tells a story that does not accord with informants\u2019 accounts or with other known facts. \u2022\u2022 The patient does not cooperate with the evaluation. Malingering is easy to suspect and difficult to prove. In the absence of definitive observa - tion (you watch as someone places sand into a urine specimen or holds a thermometer over a glowing light bulb), a resolute and clever malingerer can be almost impossible to detect. When malingering involves symptoms that are strictly mental or emotional, detection may be impossible. Moreover, the consequences of this diagnosis are dire: It provides closure in such a way as to totally alienate the clinician from the patient. I therefore recommend that you make this diagnosis only in the most obvious and imperative of circumstances.

These are not included in DSM-5, but they are a part of ICD-10. I provide them here anyway. Additional Codes 599 Z03.89 [V71.09] Encounter for Observation for Other Suspected Diseases and Conditions Ruled Out This rather clumsy and way too long designation (ICD-9 has it as a slightly smaller mouthful\u2014observation of other suspected mental condition ) means that the patient does not have a major mental disorder or personality disorder. Of course, that won\u2019t often be the case, but every mental health practitioner at some time or other is likely to encounter patients who have no mental disorder. If (when) I use it, I\u2019ll write down one of the numbers given above but just call it \u201cNo mental disorder.\u201d F48.9 [300.9] Unspecified Nonpsychotic Mental Disorder There are one or two situations in which a diagnosis of unspecified nonpsychotic mental disorder may be appropriate: \u2022\u2022 The diagnosis you want to give is not contained in DSM-5. \u2022\u2022 You know that a patient has a mental disorder, but you have insufficient infor - mation to state what it is, and no other unspecified category seems appropriate. Once you have obtained more information, you should be able to change this to a more specific diagnosis. If you cannot even be sure that the patient has no psychotic symptoms, you\u2019d have to use the next code. F99 [799.9] Mental Illness, Unspecified (Diagnosis Deferred) Here is a designation you should hardly ever use\u2014as a final diagnosis\u2014but one that I frequently deploy at first evaluation. It means that you don\u2019t have even enough informa- tion to be sure what chapter of DSM-5 your patient belongs in (if you did, you could use, for example, unspecified depressive disorder). I most often use this category to describe a patient in an admitting note (where, of course, I don\u2019t have to include any code num- bers at all). This patient could be psychotic. R69 [799.9] Unspecified Illness This one is the least specific of all, but wouldn\u2019t you think you\u2019d at least have enough information to know that it\u2019s mental? 600 OTHEr FACTOrS THAT MAY NEED CLINICAL ATTENTION 601 CHAPTEr 20 Patients and Diagnoses Clinicians use",

They don\u2019t always realize that they are using rules, but they\u2019re there, all right. Throughout my professional life, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking, talking, and writing about these rules (OK, I usually call them \u201cprinciples\u201d) and how they should be deployed. Here I\u2019m just going to list them, so we can then use them in diagnosing the mental health patients in this chapter. I hope you\u2019ll want to know more about how to understand and apply this important part of mental health practice. Diagnostic Health Care Principles As you read the patient vignettes that follow, try not to confuse the principles, which are designated with capital letters, with the DSM-5 criteria, which also have letters. Lots of luck\u2014I\u2019ve gotten turned around a time or two myself. By the way, I\u2019ve filched these from one of my own books: Diagnosis Made Easier, second edition (The Guilford Press, 2014, pp. 305\u2013306). Highly recommended. Create a Differential Diagnosis A. Arrange your differential diagnosis according to a safety hierarchy. B. Family history can guide diagnosis, but because you often can\u2019t trust reports, clinicians should attempt to rediagnose each family member. C. Physical disorders and their treatment can produce or worsen mental symp - toms. D. Consider somatic symptom (somatization) disorder whenever symptoms don\u2019t jibe or treatments don\u2019t work. E. Substance use can cause a variety of mental disorders. F. Because of their ubiquity, potential for harm, and ready response to treatment, always consider mood disorders. When Information Sources Conflict G. History beats current appearance. H. Recent history beats ancient history. I. Collateral information sometimes beats the patient\u2019s own. J. Signs beat symptoms. K. Be wary when evaluating crisis- generated data. L. Objective findings beat subjective judgment. M. Use Occam\u2019s razor: Choose the simplest explanation. N. Horses are more common than zebras; prefer the more frequently encountered diagnosis. O. Watch for contradictory information. Resolve Uncertainty P. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Q. More symptoms of a disorder increase its likelihood as your diagnosis. R. Typical features of a disorder increase",
    "explanation. N. Horses are more common than zebras; prefer the more frequently encountered diagnosis. O. Watch for contradictory information. Resolve Uncertainty P. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Q. More symptoms of a disorder increase its likelihood as your diagnosis. R. Typical features of a disorder increase its likelihood as your diagnosis; in the presence of nontypical features, look for alternatives. S. Previous typical response to treatment for a disorder increases its likelihood as your diagnosis. T. Use the word undiagnosed whenever you cannot be sure of your diagnosis. U. Consider the possibility that this patient should be given no mental diagnosis at all. Multiple Diagnoses V. When symptoms cannot be adequately explained by a single disorder, consider multiple diagnoses. W. Avoid personality disorder diagnoses when your patient is acutely ill with a major mental disorder. X. Arrange multiple diagnoses to list first the one that is most urgent, treatable, or specific. Whenever possible, also list diagnoses chronologically. 602 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES Case Histories With experience, sorting through the information from a patient\u2019s history and mental status exam becomes gradually easier. After you have evaluated 200 patients or so, you will find that the process has become virtually second nature. In the remainder of this chapter, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to try your own diagnostic skills on a variety of patients. Some of them have multiple mental disorders, which may be the norm rather than the exception. A national survey of adults in the general population found that of those who had a lifetime history of at least one disorder, over 60% had more than one. About 14% of all Americans have three or more lifetime diagnoses. Due to space requirements, these case histories have been somewhat abridged. Other clinicians might disagree with some of my conclusions; my main purpose in presenting them is to demonstrate how a clinician reasons through the facts to arrive at a diagnosis. Here\u2019s one additional suggestion. People learn more rapidly when they are actively involved. So rather than just reading the vignettes and my discussions, I suggest that you try to figure out the diagnoses yourself, using the diagnostic principles and my DSM-5 Essential Features. Then compare your answers to mine.

    "figure out the diagnoses yourself, using the diagnostic principles and my DSM-5 Essential Features. Then compare your answers to mine. Laura Freitas Laura Freitas, a 32-year-old divorced woman, was admitted to a mental health unit with this chief complaint: \u201cI\u2019m God.\u201d She was referred from an outpatient clinic and served as her own chief informant. Laura had had her first episode of mental illness at age 19, after her second baby was born. She could remember little about this period, except that it was called a \u201cpost- partum psychosis\u201d and she had spent some time in isolation for dancing nude in the hospital day room. She had recovered and remained well until 3 years ago, when, for reasons she could not remember, she was placed on lithium carbonate. She had taken this medication from then until 7 or 8 days ago, when she stopped because \u201cI felt so well, so powerful that I knew I didn\u2019t need it.\u201d Over the next several days she became increasingly agitated, slept little, and talked a great deal, until friends finally brought her for treatment. Laura had been born in Illinois, where her father was an automobile mechanic. She was an only child who often felt that her parents \u201cwould have been happier with no children at all.\u201d She described them both as \u201calcoholics\u201d and noted that she had run away from them overnight on at least one occasion when she was 13. She had twice experimented with marijuana when she was a teenager, but she denied using other drugs, including alcohol. At 18 Laura had been briefly married to a bread salesman, with whom she had had two children. The daughter, 13, lived with her father. The son, 14, was hyperactive and had at one time been treated with Ritalin. Laura was a fallen-away Catholic who for the Laura Freitas 603 past 2 years had worked at a travel agency. She stated that her health had been \u201cabove perfect,\u201d meaning that she had had no allergies or medical problems, other than a ton- sillectomy when she was 6 and a tubal ligation after the birth of her daughter. Family history was positive for alcoholism in both parents and both grandfathers. A paternal aunt would intermittently \u201cgo to pieces,\u201d becoming excessively religious and imagining various sins for which she felt excessive guilt. Laura was a somewhat overweight woman who looked about her stated age.",
    "the birth of her daughter. Family history was positive for alcoholism in both parents and both grandfathers. A paternal aunt would intermittently \u201cgo to pieces,\u201d becoming excessively religious and imagining various sins for which she felt excessive guilt. Laura was a somewhat overweight woman who looked about her stated age. She was quite agitated, jumping out of her chair every few moments to pace to the door and back. Given breakfast during a part of this interview, she intentionally smeared grape jelly onto the trousers of a passing nurse. Subsequently, she lay down on the floor and kicked her legs in the air, apparently in ecstasy. Laura seemed to be struggling to control her speech; even so, she skipped from one subject to another. However, the rate at which she spoke was approximately nor - mal. Her affect was clearly elevated, and she declared that she had never felt better in her life. She admitted that she might hear voices singing (the interviewer could hear no music); she enjoyed singing along with what she heard. She stated that she was \u201cthe All- Powerful One\u201d and that she now realized that she had no need for medication. Laura was oriented to person, place, and time. She named five recent presidents, and correctly (and extremely rapidly) subtracted serial sevens into the negative num - bers. When she finished, she apologized for taking so long to complete a task working with numbers. \u201cAfter all,\u201d she remarked, \u201cI created them.\u201d Evaluation of Laura Freitas Two diagnostic areas stand out in Laura\u2019s case\u2014 psychosis and mood disturbance. Psychosis can be dealt with summarily: Her delusions were too brief for any of the psychotic diagnoses except brief psychotic disorder or substance- induced psychotic disorder. However, each of these requires that a mood disorder not better explain the symptoms, and that, as we will note, was not the case: Laura\u2019s previous manic episodes would disqualify her for any psychotic disorder. Laura\u2019s current symptoms strongly suggest a manic episode. It appears that a pre- vious clinician also had thought so: She was successfully treated with lithium (specific for the bipolar disorders) until shortly before this admission. Let us work through the steps necessary to diagnose manic episode (see p. 116): 1. Quality of mood. Elevated mood was shown in the expansive way Laura expressed herself and in her statement that she had never felt better. 2. Duration. Her",
    "the bipolar disorders) until shortly before this admission. Let us work through the steps necessary to diagnose manic episode (see p. 116): 1. Quality of mood. Elevated mood was shown in the expansive way Laura expressed herself and in her statement that she had never felt better. 2. Duration. Her current symptoms had lasted at least 1 week. Information from informants (principle I) would probably establish that the onset of her present episode was even longer ago, perhaps at the point that she began to feel increas- ingly \u201cwell.\u201d 3. Symptoms. Laura had at least four symptoms (three are required) for manic 604 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES episode. She was grandiose (she was calling herself God and claiming that her physical health was \u201cabove perfect\u201d). She also had agitation, excessive speech, and decreased need for sleep. I might point out, too, that she had a lot of typical symptoms of mania (principle R). 4. Impairment. This was clearly demonstrated by Laura\u2019s admission to the hospi- tal, where she smeared jelly on a nurse. 5. Exclusions. None were noted, including substance use (she had used mari - juana only when she was a teenager) and general medical conditions. However, hyperthyroidism and other endocrine disorders should be ruled out by routine laboratory testing upon admission. Laura would therefore fulfill the basic criteria for manic episode. No general medi- cal condition or cognitive disorder would seem more likely (diagnostic principle C). If any further confirmation was needed, she had an aunt who might have had a recurrent psychosis. This sort of family history (principle B) would better support a remitting condition such as bipolar I disorder than a chronic psychosis such as schizophrenia. Furthermore, the safety principle (A) demands that we consider more treatable disor - ders first. And, just to rub it in, reread principle F. The vignette does not indicate whether Laura had ever had an episode of depres- sion; for coding purposes, it doesn\u2019t matter. Her most recent (current) episode was manic, and she had had at least two prior episodes (one 13 years ago, one 3 years ago when she started lithium). Psychosis would qualify her for a severity level of severe, with psychotic features. Her delusion that she was God would be mood- congruent for mania. By the way, in rereading this discussion, I note that I haven\u2019t indicated any dif - ferential diagnosis. The symptoms of mania just",

By the way, in rereading this discussion, I note that I haven\u2019t indicated any dif - ferential diagnosis. The symptoms of mania just overwhelmed me, and I didn\u2019t think it would add anything to our understanding of this patient with classic bipolar I disorder. Laura would not qualify for any episode specifiers (see Table 3.3 in Chapter 3). The vignette gives no information suggesting that she also had a personality disorder. Her physical health was good. There is no evidence that her divorced status or the treatment of her son for hyperactivity would have any effect on the treatment of her mania, so I didn\u2019t list any Z-codes for her. I placed her GAF score at 25 on the basis that she was currently quite ill, with behavior influenced by delusions, though she did not seem to be in danger of hurting herself or others. Her full diagnosis would read: F31.2 [296.44] Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with mood- congruent psychotic features Adrian Branscom Adrian Branscom was a 49-year-old executive who referred himself to his company\u2019s mental health clinician. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be talking to a shrink,\u201d was his first com - ment upon entering the office. Adrian Branscom 605 After serving 2 years as a junior officer in the Army Ordnance Corps, Adrian had been recruited by a subsidiary of one of the large petroleum companies that special - ized in oil field development. Bright and energetic, he had climbed rapidly through the ranks of middle management and was in line for a vice- presidency when the recession hit. Although his share of the restructuring turned out to be no vice- presidency and a 10% pay cut, Adrian felt lucky that he still had a job. His wife\u2019s view was less sanguine. Yoshiko was a Japanese service bride. They had married during a whirlwind 2-week leave he had spent in Tokyo during Adrian\u2019s tour of duty in Asia. For the past 20 years, since the births of their daughter and son, she had stayed home with the children. \u201cShe wishes she had stayed home in Japan,\u201d Adrian commented wryly. Almost since their wedding, Yoshiko had accused him of taking her away from her people so he could \u201cdump her.\u201d",
    "the past 20 years, since the births of their daughter and son, she had stayed home with the children. \u201cShe wishes she had stayed home in Japan,\u201d Adrian commented wryly. Almost since their wedding, Yoshiko had accused him of taking her away from her people so he could \u201cdump her.\u201d In all the years they had lived together, she had never made friends. She spent most of her free time acquiring a collection of Japanese porcelain artifacts. Now she deeply resented her husband\u2019s demotion and their loss of income. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t been getting along well for years,\u201d said Adrian, \u201cbut for the last several years we\u2019ve hit one new low after another. She says if I were a real man, I\u2019d provide better for her.\u201d On many occasions, Adrian had told Yoshiko he thought they should discuss their problems. Her usual response was \u201cSo go ahead and discuss it!\u201d When he tried to state his viewpoint, she would listen for half a sentence; then \u201cShe always begins to talk over me. After starting six or eight sentences, I usually give up.\u201d Every suggestion Adrian made that they seek marital counseling provoked a torrent of invective from Yoshiko and the demand for a divorce. When he tried to discuss divorce, she cried and said that he was trying to get rid of her and that they\u2019d all be better off if she committed suicide. These tirades made him feel guilty, and they had worsened in the past month or so. Although Adrian was usually a \u201chappy-go-lucky sort of fellow,\u201d for most of the past 6 weeks he had been depressed and anxious. His appetite and energy had been unchanged, but he had had trouble sleeping most nights; he had often awakened with a pounding heart and the feeling that he was about to smother. His concentration at work and his self- confidence had both plummeted. Increasingly over the past week, he had been thinking about death and the shotgun he still had somewhere up in his attic. Frightened, he had finally decided to seek help. Adrian had been born in west central Texas, where his father taught school and did a little farming. He was the youngest of three children, all of whom managed to go to college and succeed in business or a profession. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was out of college that I realized just how dirt-poor my parents",
    "central Texas, where his father taught school and did a little farming. He was the youngest of three children, all of whom managed to go to college and succeed in business or a profession. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was out of college that I realized just how dirt-poor my parents were,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess we seemed well off because we were all happy.\u201d The family history was negative for substance use or for any other mental disorder. Adrian had never used drugs or alcohol, and had never had moods that were excessively elevated or irritable. He spent most of his time at work and had very few friends; he had never strayed from the marital bed (\u201ctwin beds,\u201d as he put it). At home, he enjoyed collecting rocks and hiking with his son. Adrian was a conservatively dressed, somewhat overweight man who looked his 606 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES stated age. He sat quietly in the office chair during the interview. Once or twice he reached for a fresh tissue to wipe his eyes. His speech was clear, coherent, relevant, and spontaneous. His mood was appropriate to the content of thought and showed normal lability. He denied having any hallucinations or delusions. He stated that he had always been \u201ca fixer\u201d\u2014that he felt it was his job to make things work for everyone. He earned a perfect score on the MMSE. His insight and judgment seemed unimpaired. \u201cI think we\u2019d all be better off if we lived apart,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThis is one thing I don\u2019t think I can fix.\u201d Evaluation of Adrian Branscom A rapid reading of Adrian\u2019s history suggests three possible diagnostic areas: mood dis - order, anxiety disorder, and problems of adjustment. To consider adjustment disorder first, it would be easy to suppose that Adrian\u2019s difficulties could be laid completely at the doorstep of his marital difficulties. After all, he had no past history of mental disor- der, and he did have an extremely troubled marriage. But he had enough symptoms to qualify for a mood disorder (see below), and the criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood quite clearly require that the criteria for no other mental disorder be fulfilled. From the information we have, his character structure, though perhaps a bit na\u00efve, revealed none of the sorts of interpersonal difficulties we would expect for a personal - ity disorder. However, in a later interview, the",
    "mood quite clearly require that the criteria for no other mental disorder be fulfilled. From the information we have, his character structure, though perhaps a bit na\u00efve, revealed none of the sorts of interpersonal difficulties we would expect for a personal - ity disorder. However, in a later interview, the clinician should obtain information from informants (principle I); the vignette gives only Adrian\u2019s interpretation of his marital strife. As for the anxiety disorders, Adrian had episodes of awakening from sleep with pounding heart and shortness of breath, and he had felt anxious for much of the previ- ous few weeks. These symptoms weren\u2019t enough to qualify for a panic attack (which can occur during sleep); naturally, we won\u2019t diagnose panic disorder. None of his symptoms would suggest specific phobia , social anxiety disorder , agoraphobia, or obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder. Although he was a war veteran, he was evidently not exposed to extremely traumatic events (as would be the case in posttraumatic stress disor - der). Generalized anxiety disorder requires a 6-month duration and more symptoms. Although Adrian was overweight, obesity does not have any known relationship to anxi- ety symptoms; it should be mentioned in his diagnostic summary, however. Finally, Adrian did have some clear-cut mood symptoms, and when you hear hoof- beats in the street, think of horses, not zebras (principle N). His symptoms included feeling depressed most of the time, insomnia, problems with concentration, feelings of guilt, and an increasing preoccupation with suicide. (DSM-5 does not credit low self- confidence and weeping as qualifying depressive symptoms.) His symptoms had been constantly present for over a month and were causing him trouble with his job. None of the exclusions would apply (general medical condition or substance use), so he would fulfill criteria for a major depressive episode and for a single episode of major depressive disorder. None of the course or episode specifiers would apply (see Chapter Adrian Branscom 607 3, Table 3.3). He fulfilled only the minimum number of symptoms, but one of these (suicidal ideas) was serious, so his clinician thought this deserved a severity rating of at least moderate. His moderate symptoms would earn him a GAF score of 60. Although Adrian had had some thoughts about suicide, he had no plans and did not appear to be at serious immediate risk. His complete diagnosis would be as follows: F32.1 [296.22] Major depressive disorder, single episode,",

What about y oshiko? Surely she deserves some sort of diagnosis. a per - sonality disorder, you might think. Of course, y oshiko\u2019s personal characteristics sound pretty alarming, very possibly enough to earn some sort of mental disorder diagnosis. There are just two problems: We haven\u2019t nearly enough information, and she isn\u2019t our patient. We haven\u2019t even interviewed her. all we have to go on is information from a drian, who may well be an acute observer; however, he isn\u2019t exactly a disinterested one, and we really must have her side of the story before making any diagnosis for her. That isn\u2019t one of my diagnostic principles, but it\u2019s one that every clinician should follow, nonetheless. Reggie Ansnes When he was 35, Reggie Ansnes was admitted to a mental hospital 3,000 miles from home. The admitting note reported that he was agitated, was somewhat grandiose, and didn\u2019t even know what city he was in. Although he talked a lot, nothing he said made much sense. \u201cI have schizophrenia,\u201d was one of his few unambiguous statements. \u201cIt must be his schizophrenia,\u201d Faye, his wife, said on the telephone to the clini - cian who admitted him. \u201cHe told me he had it once before. We\u2019ve only been married 3 years.\u201d Five years earlier, Reggie had been admitted with psychosis to a mental hospital in Boston. Faye thought that he had then believed he was the son of Jesus, but she didn\u2019t know anything else about his symptoms. A doctor had told him he had paranoid schizophrenia. He had been treated with chlorpromazine; Faye knew that because he was still taking it when they began dating. For about 2 years after that hospitalization, Reggie had been depressed. He used to complain of trouble concentrating at work, and Faye thought that not long after the hospital released him, he had had suicidal ideas. However, the depression had gradu - ally remitted, leaving him with relatively mild problems with appetite and sleep. Even these had resolved by the time they got married, and",

However, the depression had gradu - ally remitted, leaving him with relatively mild problems with appetite and sleep.

For several days before Reggie\u2019s recent business trip, he had been unusually cheer- 608 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES ful. He talked a lot, seemed to have increased energy, and arose early to complete the work he would miss while he was gone. Faye stated that her husband was in good physical health except for a \u201cslight thy - roid condition,\u201d for which he took a small dose of a thyroid medication. She thought it had been checked the last time he visited his doctor, 3 months earlier. To her knowl - edge, he neither drank nor used drugs. During his first 24 hours in the hospital, Reggie was extremely hyperactive and did not sleep at all. His mood was markedly elevated, and he spoke so fast that he was often unintelligible. His statements that could be understood included \u201cI am the son of God,\u201d and he shared some ideas for improving the operation of the hospital. He paid little attention to whatever task was at hand, so the MMSE could not be completed. Evaluation of Reggie Ansnes Thyroid disease is a general medical condition that can cause mood symptoms; how - ever, Reggie\u2019s physician had recently evaluated his thyroid condition, and it had never before produced symptoms that resembled his current condition. Reevaluation of thy- roid function tests would be a reasonable course to follow, in any event. (You\u2019re right, I am getting tired of typing \u201cprinciple C.\u201d) As for substance use, Faye\u2019s information would militate against substance- induced psychotic disorder, with onset during withdrawal. However, the blood toxicity screen should rule out any possibility of such a psychosis with onset during intoxication (such as phencyclidine intoxication). With the other history available, this would seem highly unlikely. It is much more usual for patients to use alcohol to attenuate the uncomfort - able, driven feeling caused by mania or other psychosis. A mood disorder would seem a much stronger candidate.

A mood disorder would seem a much stronger candidate. Five years earlier, Reg- gie had had grandiose delusions; afterward, he had been depressed for months or years. After a 2-year period of apparent complete normality, he had once again become psy - chotic, with elevated mood, hyperactivity, insomnia (a decreased need for sleep), and distractibility. Assuming that the tests for thyroid function and toxicity screen came back normal, he would completely fulfill the Essential Features of a manic episode (p. 116), and thus for bipolar I disorder, current episode manic (p. 129). If you like, you can check out these criteria in DSM-5\u2014it\u2019s tedious, but great exercise. The previous history of schizophrenia might appear to provide a readymade diag- nosis for this obviously psychotic patient. If Reggie\u2019s earlier illness really had been schizophrenia, it would have been in full remission until the current episode. This would be highly unusual, and with mood symptoms as prominent then as they were now, his new history would demand a serious rethink (principle H). Furthermore, no matter how psychotic Reggie might appear on cross- sectional appearance, his history of episodic illness with complete recovery virtually compels (principle G) us to diag - nose bipolar I disorder. An apparent mood disorder now and schizophrenia years ago would also violate the parsimony rule (principle M), not to mention the basic criteria for schizophrenia. reggie Ansnes 609 Reggie\u2019s current manic symptoms were markedly disabling; severe would be the only appropriate level for him. His psychotic features were completely congruent with manic themes\u2014he thought he was the son of God\u2014which dictates the code numbers listed below. The other possible specifiers (Chapter 3, Table 3.3) do not apply. His pre- vious schizophrenia diagnosis was simply wrong, and should be expunged (as far as possible) from his records. On admission, his GAF score was a low 30; by discharge, his GAF had rebounded to 90.

James\u2019s aunt was the chief informant on this occasion. \u201cHe always seemed a little cold. Kind of like his cousin, my Betty,\u201d she said. James had been pretty unconventional, even when he was little. He cared so little what other people thought that in fourth grade, when he called the teacher \u201cGristle Butt,\u201d he didn\u2019t even acknowledge the suppressed laughter of the other children. \u201cI don\u2019t think he had a single friend in school,\u201d said his aunt. \u201cHe never cracked a smile, never got angry\u2014not even when he said he thought the other kids were talking about him. He said that quite a lot, as I recall.\u201d Even when he was older, he had never showed the slightest interest in girls or curiosity about sex. When James was 14, his mother died suddenly. His father, working in another state, had no time for child care, so he was sent to live with his aunt. With no friends to speak of, he had plenty of time to study, and he did well during his first 2 or 3 years in high school. He was fond of science. Well past the time when most boys give up that sort of thing, he continued to play with the chemistry set he had received for Christmas the year he was 9. One day toward spring of his senior year, when his cousin Betty was home with her \u201cmonthlies,\u201d she lifted her skirt and offered to let James touch her. \u201cHe came and told me about it immediately,\u201d said his aunt. \u201cHe said it made him feel nause- ated.\u201d On the following day, the entire family was relieved when Betty was rehospital- ized for schizophrenia. For the next several months, James seemed to go into a decline. When his grades fell and his aunt asked why, he only shrugged. He showed no interest either in going to college or in getting a job. He spent most of his free time reading chemistry texts and making notes in the margins.

    "showed no interest either in going to college or in getting a job. He spent most of his free time reading chemistry texts and making notes in the margins. Sometimes when his aunt awakened in the early hours of the morning, she thought she heard him walking around in his room. Several times he seemed to be laughing to himself. He took to sleeping late, often past noon; gradually he stopped going to school at all. That summer Betty returned from the hospital, vastly improved on neuroleptic 610 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES medication. Within a week she confided to her mother that James had warned her not to take the medication. It was part of a plot by Mormons, he had told her, to make her sterile. Several times during the next 2 months, he lectured her about extraterrestrials. James had stopped eating much of anything and lost at least 20 pounds. Weight loss and sleep disturbance made him look gaunt and older. Just before Thanksgiving he broke the window and cut himself, and was finally admitted to the same hospital where Betty had been a patient. Apart from his lack of friends and his separation from his parents, James\u2019s early life had not been remarkable. He had experimented with marijuana a few times, but had never used other street drugs or alcohol. He smoked about a pack of cigarettes a day. His only medical problem had been an operation for an umbilical hernia when he was 5. Besides his cousin, the family history was positive for alcoholism in his paternal grandfather and hyperthyroidism in both his father and an uncle. His mother had been \u201cnervous.\u201d James was thin and sallow, and looked several years older than his age. He was dressed in tattered, cut-off blue jean shorts and a T-shirt. His tennis shoes had no laces, so he scuffed slowly into the interview room, head down, gazing at the ground. Though his facial expression was almost always blank, he would occasionally laugh and turn his head to the side as if he had heard something. He initially denied that he was hearing voices, but later in the day admitted to a second interviewer that a woman\u2019s voice kept telling him to \u201cjack off.\u201d He denied having any delusions, including grandeur or perse- cution. Asked directly about a Mormon conspiracy to sterilize his cousin, he said that he wasn\u2019t at liberty",
    "was hearing voices, but later in the day admitted to a second interviewer that a woman\u2019s voice kept telling him to \u201cjack off.\u201d He denied having any delusions, including grandeur or perse- cution. Asked directly about a Mormon conspiracy to sterilize his cousin, he said that he wasn\u2019t at liberty to discuss it. James claimed not to be depressed or suicidal; he said he had broken the window and lacerated his arm because he was \u201cupset.\u201d He scored 28 out of 30 on the MMSE (he did not know the date within 2 days or the name of the hospital). Although he agreed that he needed medical attention for his arm, he had no insight about his mental dis - order. Evaluation of James Chatterton James had symptoms in three areas of clinical interest: psychotic thinking, somatic symptoms, and social and personality problems. The somatic symptoms (which included loss of appetite and weight loss), and a family history of hyperthyroidism, should cause his clinician to consider a general medical condition as a possible cause of his psychosis (principle C). Upon admission he would receive a complete physical exam and relevant laboratory testing, which would include thyroid tests. For the purposes of this discus - sion, let us assume the absence of thyroid disease. The discussion of James\u2019s psychotic thinking follows the outline of the section in Chapter 2 called \u201cDistinguishing Schizophrenia from Other Psychotic Disorders\u201d (p. 60). First, the extent of symptoms must be considered: Did James have enough to meet criterion A for schizophrenia? His active psychotic symptoms included persecu- tory delusions (the Mormon plot, extraterrestrials) and the hallucinated woman\u2019s voice James Chatterton 611 giving him commands. These two symptoms by themselves would be enough to fulfill criterion A, but he also had the negative symptom of loss of volition (his grades declined and he showed no interest in work or college). Although his behavior suggested other- wise, James at first denied hearing voices. This demonstrates the value of principle J (signs beat symptoms), which was confirmed later when he admitted to another inter - viewer that he was in fact having auditory hallucinations. Laughing to himself (possibly responding to something funny his hallucinated voices said) and having a relative with schizophrenia (principle B) also point strongly to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The course of a psychotic disorder is extremely important in determining diag - nosis. James\u2019s disorder began",
    "in fact having auditory hallucinations. Laughing to himself (possibly responding to something funny his hallucinated voices said) and having a relative with schizophrenia (principle B) also point strongly to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The course of a psychotic disorder is extremely important in determining diag - nosis. James\u2019s disorder began gradually, without precipitating factors, and progressed without remission or recovery. That doesn\u2019t constitute a criterion, but it sure sounds like schizophrenia. Here\u2019s the criterion (DSM-5 schizophrenia criterion C, actually): Including the prodromal period when he began to withdraw and show lack of voli - tion, he had been ill longer than 6 months (from about April to November). Premorbid personality is discussed below. The consequences were also severe enough for a diag - nosis of schizophrenia: They severely interfered with James\u2019s social life and his ability to attend school (principle B). With this many typical symptoms of schizophrenia, we become increasingly persuaded that that should be the diagnosis (principle Q). The rest of our job vis-\u00e0-vis the schizophrenia criteria is just to rule out other diag- noses. The possibility of another medical condition causing psychotic symptoms has already been discussed and, for the sake of argument, dismissed (DSM-5 criterion E for schizophrenia). James had tried marijuana a few times, but had not used substances enough to account for his remarkable deterioration (also criterion E). He scored 2 points short of perfect on the MMSE, well above the range for a cognitive disorder. Although James had lost weight, slept poorly, and cut his wrist on glass, when he was admitted to the hospital he could not explain why he had cut his wrist. Moreover, he not only denied feeling depressed; his affect was at times inappropriate. Ergo, I\u2019d dismiss mood disorders, even though, for safety reasons, they almost always appear toward the top of my differential diagnoses (principle A). Finally, we must consider social and personality problems. According to his aunt, from the time he was a little boy, James had been identified by others as \u201cdifferent.\u201d He was emotionally distant (schizoid personality disorder criterion A1), didn\u2019t care what others thought (A6), had no close friends (A5), showed few expressions of emotion (A7), and preferred solitary activities (A2). We have only his aunt\u2019s perspective on his lack of interest in sex, but still he has one symptom more than the required four for schizoid personality disorder. He also had some ideas",

We have only his aunt\u2019s perspective on his lack of interest in sex, but still he has one symptom more than the required four for schizoid personality disorder. He also had some ideas of reference (the other children might be talking about him)\u2014a symptom of schizotypal personality disorder\u2014but his aunt did not report other odd beliefs or peculiar speech or behaviors; James was generally more aloof than peculiar. The absence of any other symptoms of suspiciousness would also rule out paranoid personality disorder. In DSM-IV Made Easy , I discussed James\u2019s schizophrenia subtype. With delu - sions, hallucinations, and an affect that was both flat and at times inappropriate (gig - gling), the only conclusion I could reach was that his was schizophrenia of the undif - 612 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES ferentiated type. With the DSM-5 criteria, however, that exercise has been rendered moot, though it\u2019s still interesting\u2014to clinicians of a certain age. He had not yet been ill with active-phase symptoms for a year, so he would receive no course specifier. I have already noted his personality disorder, to which the qualifier (premorbid) would be added because it was present long before his schizophrenia began. James also had a notable problem with sleep, but should it receive an independent diagnosis? He would meet most of the criteria for insomnia related to schizophrenia, but it was neither the predominant complaint nor a major focus for treatment. Persis - tent insomnia of this sort usually normalizes once the underlying psychosis has been successfully treated, so we cannot say it deserves independent evaluation. With a GAF score of 20, James\u2019s full diagnosis would be as follows: F20.9 [295.90] Schizophrenia F60.1 [301.20] Schizoid personality disorder (premorbid) S61.519A [881.02] Laceration of wrist you may have noticed that at the start of my evaluation of James, I mentioned \u201careas of clinical interest.\u201d Well, what are those? Many years ago, I thought it would aid explanation to divide all the symptoms you might encounter in patients into groups. I ended up with seven groups, three of which were psychotic thinking, somatic symptoms, and social and personality problems . Here are the rest: mood symptoms, anxiety symptoms, cognitive problems, and substance use. I\u2019ve written much, much more about them in my book The First Interview, now in its fourth edition",

Here are the rest: mood symptoms, anxiety symptoms, cognitive problems, and substance use. I\u2019ve written much, much more about them in my book The First Interview, now in its fourth edition (The Guilford Press, 2014). Gail Downey \u201cGo ahead, cut!\u201d Gail Downey lay flat on her hospital bed, staring at the ceiling. Her hair was carefully washed and combed, but her expression was stiff. \u201cI want a lobotomy. I\u2019ll sign the papers. I can\u2019t take this anymore.\u201d Gail was an attractive 34-year-old divorcee with three children. For 5 years she had had depressions but no manias or hypomanias. Her treatment had been marked by frequent suicide attempts and hospitalizations. In her current episode, which had lasted nearly 5 weeks, she had felt severely depressed throughout nearly every day. She complained that she lay awake each night until the early hours; she had no pep, interest, or appetite. She cried frequently, and she was so distracted by her emotional turmoil that her boss had reluctantly let her go. Gail had been prescribed at least six antidepressants, often in combination. Most of these seemed to help the depression initially, raising her mood enough that she could at least return home. She also had responded positively to each of several courses of ECT. Within a few months of each new treatment she would relapse and return to the Gail Downey 613 hospital, often with a fresh set of stitches in her wrist. While on a brief pass from the present hospitalization, she had swallowed a nearly fatal overdose of chloral hydrate. After Gail\u2019s parents had divorced when she was 9, she had been reared by her mother. Since the age of 13, Gail had been arrested three or four times for taking small items such as pantyhose or a tube of lipstick from department stores. Each of these incidents had occurred while she was under particular stress, usually because a job or personal relationship was going sour. She always noted increasing tension before taking these items, and felt nearly explosive joy each time she left the store with her trophy in the pocket of her overcoat. As a juvenile, whenever she was caught she had been remanded to the custody of her mother; once she had paid a fine. The most recent episode had",
    "these items, and felt nearly explosive joy each time she left the store with her trophy in the pocket of her overcoat. As a juvenile, whenever she was caught she had been remanded to the custody of her mother; once she had paid a fine. The most recent episode had occurred just before this hospitalization. This time, the charges had been dropped because of her repeated suicide attempts. Gail\u2019s medical history was a catalog of symptoms. It included urinary retention, a lump in her throat that seemed about to strangle her, chest pains, severe menstrual cramps, vomiting spells, chronic diarrhea, heart palpitations, migraine headaches (a neurologist said they were \u201cnot typical\u201d), and even a brief episode of blindness (from which she had recovered without treatment). At the time of the divorce, Gail\u2019s husband had confided that she had been \u201cfrigid\u201d and often complained of pain during inter - course. Starting in her teens, she had taken medicine or consulted a physician for more than 30 such symptoms. The doctors had never found much wrong with her physically; they had either given her tranquilizers or referred her to a succession of psychiatrists. After several years Gail had been evicted from her apartment, and her husband had obtained custody of their three children. The only nonmedical person she ever talked to was her mother. Now she was demanding an operation that would perma - nently sever some of the connections within her brain. Evaluation of Gail Downey Gail had more than enough mood symptoms (low mood, loss of pleasure, insomnia, anorexia, suicide ideas, loss of energy, trouble thinking) to qualify her current episode as a major depressive episode (you can review the features on p. 112). Any patient who presents with severe depression should be evaluated for major depressive disorder (principle F), which can be potentially life- threatening and often responds quickly to the appropriate therapy. Gail had had numerous episodes of depression, but no manias or hypomanias and no psychotic symptoms; she had also apparently recovered for at least 2 months between episodes. She would therefore qualify for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, recurrent. The persistent suicide attempts would mark it as severe without psychotic features. The vignette does not give enough information to support other specifiers. But the fact that Gail\u2019s depression had been treated so often and so unsuc - cessfully is a problem. Response to typical treatment",
    "major depressive disorder, recurrent. The persistent suicide attempts would mark it as severe without psychotic features. The vignette does not give enough information to support other specifiers. But the fact that Gail\u2019s depression had been treated so often and so unsuc - cessfully is a problem. Response to typical treatment for a disorder points in favor of it (principle S), but can we say the inverse? There\u2019s no diagnostic principle to that effect, 614 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES but perhaps there should be: \u201cRepeated failure to respond to typical treatment should prompt consideration of some other condition.\u201d However, since her teens Gail had also had a variety of somatic symptoms, at least some of which (like the migraines) were atypical, so we need to consider somatic symp- tom disorder (principle D). We\u2019re going to evaluate her somatic symptoms twice; first with the official DSM-5 description (p. 251), then with the old DSM-IV guidelines for somatization disorder (sidebar, p. 256). She would adequately fulfill the former: at least one somatic symptom that caused marked distress and disrupted her life in some important ways. She had been symptomatic far longer than the 6 months required, and she had experienced a high degree of anxiety relevant to her symptoms. Of course, she would also meet the DSM-IV somatization disorder criteria, which I believe are far more valuable for identifying actual pathology. These symptoms were distributed appropriately for that diagnosis. Among the medical and neurological dis- orders to consider would be multiple sclerosis, spinal cord tumors, and diseases of the heart and lungs. The fact that she had been unsuccessfully treated by so many physi - cians would reduce the likelihood that she instead had a series of other medical condi- tions (principle C). The vignette provides no evidence that Gail consciously feigned her symptoms for gain (malingering) or for less concrete motives (factitious disorder). No additional diagnosis is needed for Gail\u2019s anorexia (principle M); any problem with maintaining body weight was not due to refusal of food, but to her lack of appetite. Her insomnia could be given a separate diagnosis ( insomnia disorder with non-sleep disorder mental comorbidity) had it been serious enough to warrant independent clin- ical evaluation; it wasn\u2019t. Similarly, her sexual dysfunction would not be independently coded (even if the vignette gave enough specifics as to its exact nature), because it is easily explained as a symptom of somatic symptom",
    "with non-sleep disorder mental comorbidity) had it been serious enough to warrant independent clin- ical evaluation; it wasn\u2019t. Similarly, her sexual dysfunction would not be independently coded (even if the vignette gave enough specifics as to its exact nature), because it is easily explained as a symptom of somatic symptom disorder. Oh, and she didn\u2019t abuse substances, so that\u2019s one more item to cross off our list. Finally, Gail\u2019s history revealed a pattern of repeated shoplifting (see kleptomania, p. 390) characterized by tension and release. These features cannot be explained on the basis of anger or revenge or indeed on the basis of some other mental disorder. Hence we must also give her a diagnosis of kleptomania (principle V). Gail thus had three codable mental diagnoses. How should they be listed? Her major depressive disorder was serious enough that it had been the focus of treatment for at least 5 years; at the beginning of her treatment, that approach was probably sound (principle X). Now, however, that same principle X suggests something quite different: If we make somatization disorder (OK, we can call it somatic symptom disorder for the sake of DSM-5) the focus of her care, it will suggest a common approach to several of her problems. Although the somatic symptom disorder criteria don\u2019t specify severity, Gail\u2019s clinician, who wanted to indicate how seriously ill she had been, used \u201cclinician\u2019s prerogative\u201d and rated her as severely ill. The vignette gives little information about her personality; we need to add a note to her diagnostic summary that indicates the need for further exploration. Besides, it\u2019s best to avoid diagnosing a personality disorder while depression and other matters are Gail Downey 615 so acute (principle W). Considering all of her recent history, she would earn a low GAF score of 40.

As a pediatrician, I\u2019ve got lots better things to do.\u201d \u201cBut how did you come to be here, on the locked unit?\u201d the student interviewer wanted to know. Reena settled comfortably into her chair. \u201cIt\u2019s the only ward in the hospital that has no TVs in the rooms.\u201d The student looked perplexed. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid my seizures will be exacerbated by the flicker of the televisions,\u201d she explained patiently. \u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the phenomenon of induced seizures, right? Good. Over the years, I had a couple of kid patients with the same problem. Never dreamed I\u2019d someday be the one affected.\u201d She was controlled pretty well now, on medication\u2014the name of which she couldn\u2019t recall right now. Reena continued her story. She had grown up near Modesto, the daughter of itin- erant farm workers who made their living picking fruit and hoeing tomatoes. The family had moved around a good deal, so by age 18 she\u2019d attended \u201cliterally dozens of different schools.\u201d But a scholarship committee at her last high school had plucked her from the fields and sent her off to college. From there, her intelligence and her determination to escape her parents\u2019 lifestyle carried her through medical school in southern California and into a career caring for children. She had been instrumental, she remarked with pride, in developing one of the definitive tests for cystic fibrosis in neonates. \u201cI believe it was my finest hour,\u201d she almost whispered. Now 59, her chief regret was that a botched D&C and subsequent hysterectomy when she was in her early 30s meant she\u2019d never been able to have children of her own. By now, the student interviewer had bogged down, unsure what to ask next. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to hear about my family,\u201d Reena prompted with a kind smile. She told about her father (a quiet, gentle man who had never spoken a cross word) and her mother (still living at 97, a saint among women, who still drove her own car).

Reena had 616 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES married twice, first to a fellow medical student, who had years ago died as a medical missionary in Uganda. About 10 years later she had married again, this time to a psy - chiatrist who was still practicing in the town where they lived. Because of his workload, he hadn\u2019t yet been able to visit her. \u201cCould you tell us how you got to the hospital\u2014I mean, what led up to it?\u201d Reena explained that when she had one of her seizures, she would often behave automatically. \u201cIt\u2019s called a complex partial seizure, you know? Good. I\u2019ll lose track of where I am, but my body plugs right ahead. I can walk and walk, sometimes miles. This time, they found me outside the home of an actor I used to know. The police said I was \u2018lurking.\u2019 \u201d She laughed with infectious humor, and the class joined in. A few minutes later, Reena had departed, and the instructor asked the students how they\u2019d evaluate her. Her calm and pleasant demeanor and logical presentation seemed highly persuasive to several in the class. \u201cPerhaps, then, we should just take her story at face value,\u201d suggested the instructor. That would make hers one of the rare (on mental health wards) cases of no mental diagnosis (principle U). On the other hand, one student pointed out, there was the niggling matter of her medication, the name of which she couldn\u2019t recall despite her own status as a medical practitioner. Of course, it could have been just a senior moment, but was it instead the sort of contradictory evidence (principle O) that encourages us to rethink her whole story? Now that they considered it further, wouldn\u2019t it be possible just to turn off the television in a room on any medical ward in the hospital? Until they had more data, the class agreed to consider her as undiagnosed (principle T). That\u2019s when the student who, during the discussion, had been smiling quietly to herself offered some context. She had been involved in discussions with the team that cared for Reena, and she shared the following additional information. About the only wholly accurate statement Reena had made was",
    "undiagnosed (principle T). That\u2019s when the student who, during the discussion, had been smiling quietly to herself offered some context. She had been involved in discussions with the team that cared for Reena, and she shared the following additional information. About the only wholly accurate statement Reena had made was her name. She\u2019d never been to medical school, never even graduated from college. None of her three husbands had been a physician\u2014she was now once again divorced\u2014and her parents had both been dead for years. Reena herself had once worked as a medical receptionist; there she had picked up the jargon that she deployed with such precision. Reena\u2019s belief that she had a seizure disorder seemed genuine (time after time, she\u2019d been closely quizzed on this issue). She could describe the early sensation of a smell of tomatoes (\u201cfrom the fields of my childhood, I suppose\u201d), followed by the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that almost always preceded the prolonged periods of unconsciousness, dur- ing which she would often wander through strange neighborhoods. Over the years, she\u2019d been worked up several times for a seizure disorder, but all of her MRIs and EEGs (some with pharyngeal leads) had been normal. No one had ever seen her actu - ally having a seizure. (Did she then have factitious disorder, someone asked? But she\u2019d only ever been treated in one town, and at one hospital, and she hadn\u2019t been observed to manufacture symptoms. Was she malingering? If so, where was the gain?) On the other hand, she did have a rather long rap sheet with local police. Each contact had been related to her fascination (if that was the appropriate word) with a local actor who had had occasional success in television. For years she had followed reena Walters 617 his career, the actor himself, and her inclination to be near him, leading to repeated arrests for stalking and half a dozen restraining orders. The student ended with, \u201cAnd if you ask her, she\u2019ll be happy to tell you that she\u2019s pregnant.

    "The presence of multiple delusions for many years (delusional disorder criterion A) without ever fulfilling criterion A for schizophrenia (delusional disorder criterion B) launches this rare condition to the forefront of our differential diagnosis. (OK, Reena did mention the olfactory hallucination of tomatoes, but this was closely associated with her delusional seizures; this sort of hallucination doesn\u2019t really count toward fulfilling criterion A for schizophrenia and is often encountered in delusional disorder.) Outside the context of her specific delusions, her behavior and affect seemed rather ordinary (C), and there was no evidence of associated mood episodes (D). Of course, her personal history presents any number of possible confounds that we have to eliminate before making a definitive diagnosis. We\u2019d need to learn whether she used substances (F)\u2014and, considering the mendacity of her other statements, that information should come from some more reliable source. There was no informa - tion to support a different mental condition, specifically body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder (D). As to the type of delusions, I\u2019d say they were largely somatic (she believed she had temporal lobe epilepsy). Only hinted at were her possibly grandiose ideas of having a relationship with the actor. If you prefer a more comprehensive (but vague) classification, call the delusions mixed type. I\u2019d rate her GAF as about 35, though I\u2019d be happy to entertain arguments. And I\u2019d certainly sup - port something in her summary that points the way to a full evaluation of her personal- ity structure\u2014but later. F22 [297.1] Delusional disorder, somatic type Z65.3 [V62.5] Restraining orders Sara Winkler Before she sat down, Sara Winkler crossed herself three times. She and her husband were each 25, and they had been married 4 years. \u201cI\u2019ve known her since we were 16,\u201d Loren Winkler said, \u201cand she\u2019s always been pretty careful. You know, checking the stove to see that it\u2019s turned off, or the doors to make sure that they\u2019re really locked before we go out. It\u2019s only been the last couple of years that it\u2019s been so much worse.\u201d Sara was a college graduate who had worked briefly as a paralegal assistant before taking time out to have a family.

    "as a paralegal assistant before taking time out to have a family. She was healthy and had no history of alcohol or drug use. When their son, Jonathan, was only 6 months old, she had had a terrifying dream in which she plunged a paring knife into the chest of a doll as it lay on the kitchen table. She recognized the doll as one she had owned as a child. But as the knife entered the 618 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES plastic body, its arms and legs began to move, and she saw that it was a real child. On the kitchen wall, the word KILL seemed to scroll upward before her eyes, and she awakened screaming. It had taken her several hours to get back to sleep. The following evening, while slicing carrots for a salad, she suddenly had this thought: \u201cWould I ever harm Jonathan?\u201d Although the idea seemed absurd, it was accompanied by some of the same anxieties she had felt the night before. She took the baby in to Loren while she finished preparing dinner. After that, thoughts of knives and of stabbing someone smaller and weaker had increasingly wormed their way into Sara\u2019s consciousness. Even if her mind was fixed on reading or watching television, she might suddenly visualize the giant block letters KILL arising before her eyes. The idea that she would actually harm Jonathan seemed irrational to her, but the nagging doubts and anxiety tormented her daily. She no longer trusted herself in the kitchen with him. Sometimes she could almost feel the muscles of her forearm begin to contract in the act of reaching for a knife. Although she had never followed through on one of these impulses, the thought that she might do so terrified her. Now she refused even to open the knife drawer; any cutting had to involve scissors, the food processor, or her husband. Not long after her dream, Sara began trying to ward off her troubling thoughts and impulses. A fallen-away Catholic, she reverted to some of the practices she had known as a child. When she had one of her frightening thoughts, she initially felt comforted if she crossed herself. If she was carrying packages or Jonathan, she muttered a Hail Mary. With time, the power of these simple measures seemed to weaken. Then Sara found that if she crossed herself three times or said three",
    "had one of her frightening thoughts, she initially felt comforted if she crossed herself. If she was carrying packages or Jonathan, she muttered a Hail Mary. With time, the power of these simple measures seemed to weaken. Then Sara found that if she crossed herself three times or said three Hail Marys (or any combina- tion, in threes), she felt better. Eventually, however, she needed nine of these behaviors before she felt she had adequately protected her son and herself. When she was in public, she could cross herself once and complete the ritual by murmuring Hail Marys under her breath. Now Jonathan was nearly a year old, and several hours a day were being consumed by Sara\u2019s repetitive thoughts and activities. Jonathan was fretful, and Loren was cook - ing virtually all of their meals. For several weeks she had felt increasingly depressed; she admitted that her mood was bad nearly all the time, though she had not had sui - cidal ideas or death wishes. Nothing interested her much, and she was always tired. She had lost over 10 pounds and had insomnia; she frequently awakened screaming at night. When her husband found her doing penance 27 times in a row, he insisted they come for help. \u201cI know it seems crazy,\u201d Sara said tearfully, \u201cbut I just can\u2019t seem to get these stu- pid ideas out of my head.\u201d Evaluation of Sara Winkler For longer than 2 weeks, Sara had been depressed most of the time. Her symptoms also included insomnia, fatigue, and loss of\u2018 interest and weight, all symptoms consistent Sara Winkler 619 with a major depressive episode . She was physically healthy (principle C) and had no history of substance use (principle E). It is hard to be sure whether she was being impaired by the depression or the symptoms of obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD); it seems reasonable that she would be having problems from both. With no prior major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episodes, her diagnosis would be major depressive disorder, single episode. I\u2019d rate the severity specifier as moderate (relatively few symptoms, no suicidal ideas, but considerable distress). There was very little risk that she would actually harm her son. As for Sara\u2019s anxiety, she had neither panic attacks nor generalized anxiety dis - order. Rather, she had obsessions and compulsions, both of\u2018 which fulfilled the criteria for OCD (p. 200). (Although she had",
    "ideas, but considerable distress). There was very little risk that she would actually harm her son. As for Sara\u2019s anxiety, she had neither panic attacks nor generalized anxiety dis - order. Rather, she had obsessions and compulsions, both of\u2018 which fulfilled the criteria for OCD (p. 200). (Although she had another mental disorder, her obsessions were not confined to guilty ruminations related to her major depressive disorder.) Her OCD symptoms occupied more than an hour a day, and she was severely distressed. Clearly, Sara\u2019s concern was not just an exaggeration of a real-life problem, so her focus of con- cern was pathological. She herself recognized that she was being unreasonable; we\u2019d grade her insight as pretty good. In recording of Sara\u2019s diagnoses, the depression was listed first to indicate that her clinician regarded it as the aspect that most required clinical attention. (Others might well disagree.) Her GAF score of 45 would be justified by the severity of her rituals. F32.1 [296.22] Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate F42 [300.3] Obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder, with good insight Gemma Livingstone \u201cI eat, then I throw up.\u201d That was how Gemma Livingstone described her problem during her first interview. Beginning when she was 23, this behavior had been almost continual in the intervening 4 years. Even as a teenager, Gemma was concerned about the way she looked. Along with classmates, she had crash- dieted from time to time during high school. But her weight had seldom varied by more than a few pounds from 116. At 5 feet, 6 inches tall, she had been svelte but not too thin. Throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, she had the feeling that if she did not tightly control her eating habits, she would rapidly gain weight\u2014\u201cpuff up like a toad,\u201d as she put it. Dealing with the aftermath of an unwanted pregnancy and a subsequent abortion, Gemma had had the opportunity to test her theory. Eating what she wanted, she had ballooned from a size 8 to a size 14 in less than half a year. Once she finally regained control, she vowed she would never lose it again. For 3 years, she had bought nothing larger than a size 4. Back when Gemma was a teenager, she and her friends simply didn\u2019t eat. When - ever dining in a restaurant or with friends, she would still push her food around on her plate to",

When - ever dining in a restaurant or with friends, she would still push her food around on her plate to disguise how little she was actually taking in. But when she was at home she would often eat a full meal, then retire to the bathroom and throw up. At first, this had 620 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES required touching the back of her throat with the handle of a teaspoon she kept in the bathroom for that purpose. With practice, she had learned to regurgitate just by willing it. \u201cIt\u2019s as easy as blowing your nose,\u201d she reported later. Gemma\u2019s fear of obesity had become the organizing principle of her life. On her refrigerator door, she kept a picture of herself when she was in her \u201ctoad\u201d phase. She said that every time she looked at it, she lost her appetite. Whereas she previously relied on laxatives only for constipation, recently she had begun to use them as another means of purging her system: \u201cIf I don\u2019t have a bowel movement every day, I feel as if I\u2019ll burst. Even my eyes get all puffy.\u201d She had also taken some diuretics, but had stopped doing so when her periods stopped. She didn\u2019t really believe there was a connection, but recently she had begun to menstruate again. If there was one thing she feared more than getting fat, it was getting pregnant. She had never been very active sexually, but now she and her husband seldom had intercourse more than once a month. Even then, she insisted on using both a diaphragm and a condom. Other than her weight, which had fallen under 90 pounds, Gemma appeared to be in good health. A review of systems was positive only for abdominal bloating. Although she occasionally had a day or two of low mood and feeling sorry for herself, she laughed it off as \u201cPMS\u201d and added that it certainly wasn\u2019t bothering her now. She had never had manic episodes, hallucinations, obsessions, compulsions, phobias, panic attacks, or thoughts about suicide. Gemma had been born in Virginia Beach, where her father was stationed with the Navy. Subsequently he owned his own heating and air conditioning company, and the family was reasonably well off.",

Gemma had been born in Virginia Beach, where her father was stationed with the Navy. Subsequently he owned his own heating and air conditioning company, and the family was reasonably well off. Gemma was an only child. She\u2019d had no history of any kind of difficulties with learning or conduct while she was in school. She and her husband were married when she was 21, after she had worked 3 years as a bank teller. They had two children, a son who was 7 and a daughter age 5. Gemma\u2019s only brush with the law had occurred 2 years earlier, when she\u2019d forged some prescriptions to obtain amphetamines for dieting. She had copped a plea and been placed on probation for a year; she\u2019d scrupulously avoided amphetamines since then. She had tried marijuana once or twice when she was first out of high school, but had never used alcohol or tobacco. Her only surgical procedure had been bilateral breast augmentation, which had been done with autologous fat rather than silicone. In a separate interview, Gemma\u2019s husband stated that he thought his wife felt inade- quate and insecure. He said that she usually dressed in revealing, even alluring clothing, which looked less enticing now that she had lost so much weight. When she was denied her way, she would sometimes pout for hours, though he didn\u2019t think there was much real feeling behind this expression of her emotion. \u201cShe loves to be the center of attention,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a lot of people don\u2019t buy into her act any more. I think it frustrates her.\u201d Gemma was a dark- haired, slightly built woman who had probably been quite pretty before she\u2019d lost so much weight. She smiled readily and somewhat self- consciously, as if she were trying to make her cheeks dimple. She wore a V-necked blouse and a very short skirt that she did not attempt to pull down when she crossed her legs. She spoke with a good deal of rolling of eyes and varying inflections of her voice, but her answers Gemma Livingstone 621 to the examiner\u2019s questions were themselves vague and often discursive.

She denied feeling depressed or wishing she were dead; she had never had delusions or hallucina- tions, but she claimed that she was still \u201cfat as a pig.\u201d To illustrate, she pinched between thumb and forefinger a fold of skin that hung loosely from her arm. She scored a perfect 30 on the MMSE. Evaluation of Gemma Livingstone Gemma had a history of disordered eating that dated back to her high school years. She bore the following features of anorexia nervosa : She was gaunt and fearful of gaining weight, and she perceived herself as being fat. Her current subtype would be binge- eating/purging type; as a teenager, she had been of the restricting type. Just how severe do we rate her anorexia? The DSM-5 criteria grade solely on the basis of body mass index (BMI), which is an error, in my opinion; surely the type of behavior should count for something. Gemma\u2019s weight is under 90 (let\u2019s say 89), so for a height of 66 inches, her BMI works out to 14.4, putting her in the extreme category of severity. Based only on the information she herself provided, Gemma could not have been diagnosed with a personality disorder \u2014that\u2019s our usual clinical experience derived solely from a patient\u2019s own reports. But from her husband\u2019s information (principle I) and from that of the mental status evaluation (principle L), the following criteria for histrionic personality disorder were established: needing to be the center of attention, shifting and shallow emotions, drawing attention to herself (wearing revealing clothing and crossing her legs), speaking vaguely, and expressing herself dramatically. Histrionic personality disorder is often associated with somatization/somatic symptom disorder, but a review of systems revealed minimal symptoms, and she didn\u2019t express the dispro- portionate health concerns normally attached to a somatic symptom diagnosis. Forging prescriptions and using drugs are of course illegal, but Gemma hadn\u2019t pur- sued either behavior after her probation; I certainly wouldn\u2019t regard them as evidence of diagnosable pathology. With a GAF score of 45, her complete diagnosis would read as follows: F50.02 [307.1] Anorexia nervosa, binge- eating/purging type, extreme F60.4 [301.50] Histrionic personality disorder Edith Roman Seventy-six year-old Edith Roman entered the hospital on the complaint of Sylvia, her daughter: \u201cShe\u2019s been depressed since her stroke.\u201d",

This first became apparent when for 3 weeks out of 4 she neglected to place her Friday night telephone call to Sylvia, who at that time lived several hundred miles away. Each time her daughter called instead, and Edith seemed surprised to get the call. When she finally took a week off work for a visit, Sylvia discovered that Edith 622 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES had also been neglecting the marketing and housecleaning: The sink was full and the refrigerator was nearly empty, and dust blanketed everything. Although Edith\u2019s speech and physical appearance hadn\u2019t changed, something was clearly wrong. By the end of the week, Sylvia had the answer from a neurologist: early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She took an extra week off work to move her mother across the state and into her own home. A companion was hired to stay with Edith during the day, when Sylvia was absent. This arrangement worked well for several months. Edith\u2019s deterioration was grad- ual and minimal, until the stroke left her limping and unable to remember words. Now her memory was worse than ever, and this was when the depression began. When Edith talked at all, she complained to the companion about how useless and lonely she felt. She slept poorly, ate very little, cried often, and said she was a burden. Edith had been born in St. Louis, where until she was 12, her parents had run a small dry- cleaning business. Then her father died and her mother soon married Edith\u2019s paternal uncle, who came equipped with two teenagers of his own. They all got along quite well, and Edith graduated from high school, got married, and had her only child. Throughout life, she had been pleasant and spunky, interested in crafts and many other aspects of homemaking. After her husband died, she continued to be active in her social and bridge clubs. Until a year ago, her physical health had been good; she had never used alcohol or tobacco. An elderly woman dressed in a cotton nightgown and a quilted wrap, Edith",

Until a year ago, her physical health had been good; she had never used alcohol or tobacco. An elderly woman dressed in a cotton nightgown and a quilted wrap, Edith sat upright on the edge of her bed, her useless left hand lying in her lap. She made good eye contact with the examiner; although she did not speak spontaneously, she did respond to all questions. Her speech was clear, but she sometimes had difficulty finding the words she wanted. Asked to identify a magazine, she thought for a moment and called it \u201cthis papers.\u201d She admitted feeling depressed, said that she saw no future for herself, and hoped she could die soon. She denied ever experiencing hallucinations or delu - sions. On the MMSE, she scored only 16 out of a possible 30. Evaluation of Edith Roman The symptoms of Edith\u2019s major neurocognitive disorder included failing memory and deteriorating ability to care for herself (p. 492). These symptoms, consistent with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (p. 498), had begun gradually and were gradually worsening when she had her stroke. At that point, her memory abruptly worsened further, and she devel- oped aphasia (she couldn\u2019t think of certain words she wanted to use). She maintained eye contact and appeared to focus her attention on the examiner\u2014 evidence against delirium. A neurological exam earlier had not found evidence of other medical condi- tions that might better explain her symptoms. For far longer than 2 weeks, Edith had also had symptoms of depression. These included constantly depressed mood, loss of appetite and sleep, death wishes, and the feeling of being a burden (more or less equivalent to a sense of worthlessness). Her symptoms would seem to qualify for major depressive episode, which we should diag- nose whenever relevant, despite the presence of other disorders (principles F, V). How- Edith roman 623 ever, because of the presumed etiology (that is, her Alzheimer\u2019s disease), we will list her disorder as depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The exact wording for this diagnosis appears below, to which we add verbiage indicating that her symp - toms are those of a major depressive episode. Edith\u2019s dementia had two causes, each of which had created difficulties with com- munication and with everyday functioning for her and her daughter. This",

Edith\u2019s dementia had two causes, each of which had created difficulties with com- munication and with everyday functioning for her and her daughter. This would fulfill the criteria for major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, which is not really a diagnosis. Instead, it is a reminder that we can record a single set of codes for the dementia, but a separate code for each cause of dementia (p. 526). (An exception exists for vascular disease, which requires its own code.) Her depressive symptoms rate the specifier with behavioral disturbance . Her GAF score would be 31. a funny thing happened on the way to Edith Roman\u2019s diagnosis: It got tangled in a DSM-5 contradiction. The criteria for probable a lzheimer\u2019s dementia (see DSM-5, p. 611) state that there must be no evidence of mixed etiology; they give the example of cerebrovascular disease. The criteria for major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies (see DSM-5, p. 642) give as an example a lzheimer\u2019s plus cerebrovascular disease. not to worry; we\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for the patient and give both diagnoses anyway. anyone want to complain?

For all that, she seemed to have been progressing normally through both school and puberty, until one evening when she suddenly began talking, according to her mother, \u201ca blue streak.\u201d She insisted that her parents stay up with her to talk about \u201cmy agenda.\u201d At first, her mood seemed high, but she became angry when her father said he wanted to go to bed.

Her blood pressure was consistently above 230/110. When she undressed, the hospital staff could see that the skin of her abdomen bore reddened stretch marks (called striae) caused by her weight gain. 624 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES For the next several days, Clara\u2019s mood was elevated, and she needed little sleep. Even when interrupted, she wouldn\u2019t stop talking longer than a few moments. Over and over, she claimed to be the mother of Jesus; she\u2019d divined the solution to many prob - lems\u2014AIDS, sin, and global warming. She had flight of ideas, and she even admitted that her thoughts were racing. It was impossible to interrupt her longer than a moment, and hard to get her attention at all. At one point, she undressed right in front of her sev- eral visitors\u2014immodest behavior that was completely out of character for her. Clara had no previous personal history of depression or mania, and her family history was negative for mood disorder. What she did have was an abnormal serum cortisol level. An endocrinologist recommended an MRI, which revealed a pituitary adenoma. After it was surgically removed, she no longer required psychotropic medica- tions. She became euthymic and returned to school. Evaluation of Clara Widdicombe Of course, after a successful operation that yields the desired outcome, it\u2019s pretty easy to attribute mood symptoms to a tumor. The trick is to make the connection before too many months or years have elapsed. Clara\u2019s age at onset (young for bipolar disorder), her appearance (typical \u201cmoon\u201d face, marked overweight, classical abdominal striations) were diagnostic giveaways. Other patients have been less fortunate. For a week Clara was ill. She was in turns euphoric and irritable, and she had increased activity (both required for manic episode criterion A). (Note that although she had several other symptoms of mania\u2014she spoke rapidly, needed little sleep, was grandiose, and was even delusional in that she thought she was Jesus\u2019s mother\u2014a full symptom list isn\u2019t required for the diagnosis of an induced bipolar condition.)

Although we might infer from her inability to connect with other people that she was distract - ible, there isn\u2019t enough detail here to diagnose delirium (D). As far as the severity of her symptoms, she suffered from all three consequences mentioned in criterion E: psycho- sis, hospitalization, and impaired functioning. Finally, I don\u2019t see evidence of another mental disorder (C)\u2014do you? High on the list of her differential diagnoses would be bipolar I disorder , but that would require that other medical conditions and substance- induced mood disorders be ruled out first. And this brings us back to her pituitary tumor and Cushing\u2019s syndrome, which are well known to produce manic symptoms (B). On admission, I\u2019d give her a GAF score of 25. Once the final diagnosis was made, her clinicians would have to determine which (if any) of the possible specifiers she had. A handful of other medical conditions can produce symptoms of mania (see the chart in Appendix A). D35.2 [227.3] Pituitary adenoma E24.9 [255.0] Cushing\u2019s syndrome F06.33 [293.83] Bipolar disorder due to Cushing\u2019s syndrome, with manic- like episode Clara Widdicombe 625 clara\u2019s is a somewhat unusual case, in that it fully meets the DSM-5 symptomatic require- ments for manic episode. That\u2019s unusual? Probably, in that most patients in my experience have the euphoria (irritability) and overactivity, but may come up short when you look for the other qualifying symptoms\u2014 grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, and frenetic rushing from one activity to the next. Using IcD-10, we can now differentiate a c lara-type episode from those that don\u2019t fully meet manic episode criteria\u2014and depressions that do meet full symptomatic criteria for major depressive episode from those that don\u2019t. a nother benefit courtesy of the interna - tional community.

He was socially withdrawn and claimed never to take much pleasure in things. \u201cI\u2019m a pessimist, more or less,\u201d he said. Jeremy described his appetite as being fine, and he had never had suicidal ideas. His sleep, however, was another matter. With the approaching thesis deadline, he felt that he had to stay up most nights in order to do his work. Therefore, he drank lots of coffee. \u201cIf I have to sleep less than 8 hours a night, I drink a cup every 2 or 3 hours. When I\u2019m up all night, it\u2019s four or five cups. Strong coffee.\u201d Other than coffee, Jeremy denied ever misusing substances such as alcohol or street drugs. Lately, Jeremy had stayed up all night three nights a week; he always felt tired. He also admitted to chronic feelings of guilt and irritability. He had never had crying spells, but his concentration was \u201ca lifelong major problem.\u201d For example, while he was working at the computer, other thoughts and worries intruded upon his consciousness, to the point that he had difficulty getting his work done. Jeremy also complained of anxiety. Toward the end of supper, for example, he would begin to worry about the amount of work he had to do. A knot would tighten in his stomach, and the world would seem to be closing in. Time of day made little dif - ference to how he felt, but he would usually improve briefly once he turned in a term paper or other major assignment. He denied ever having problems with shortness of breath, muscle twitching, or palpitations of his heart, unless he had had an extraordi - narily large amount of coffee. At those times, he also would notice that he felt nervous and often had an upset stomach, sometimes to the point that he had to stay home from class. He denied feelings of impending doom or disaster. Though Jeremy had always been a list maker, he didn\u2019t describe any obsessional 626 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES thinking or compulsive behavior.

He described himself as a person who had always had difficulty making decisions, even to the point that he couldn\u2019t discard worthless things that he no longer needed\u2014an Easter basket from when he was 10 was one example. Jeremy had been born in Brazil, where his father had been studying insects of the rain forests. The family returned to live in southern California when Jeremy was 4. His mother was a professional harpist; she had been in therapy with one counselor or another for 25 years. She had always been somewhat dour and had never gotten much pleasure out of life. When Jeremy was 16, she had obtained a divorce, because she had never felt that her husband was committed to their relationship. After the divorce, she had changed to such an extent that she had finally consented to take an antidepressant medication. It had \u201cturned her life around,\u201d and now she was happy for the first time in her life. It was partly at her urging that Jeremy was now seeking treatment. Several maternal relatives had had depression, including a cousin who\u2019d killed himself by drinking antifreeze. Another relative had also committed suicide, but Jer - emy didn\u2019t know the details. When Jeremy was in high school, he had been \u201cborn again\u201d; since then he had attended a fundamentalist church. He so strongly condemned his father for living with another woman without marrying her that for over 2 years, father and son hadn\u2019t spoken. Jeremy\u2019s only physical problem was that he bit his nails. He had never had any legal difficulties. He had a serious girlfriend, and they were \u201ctrying very hard\u201d to refrain from overcommitting themselves sexually until they got married. Jeremy was a tall, rather gangling man whose haggard face and baggy eyes made him look almost aged. Although he moved normally and smiled readily, prominent worry lines were emerging on his forehead. His speech was clear, coherent, relevant, and spontaneous. When he talked spontaneously, it was largely to discuss his concerns about getting his thesis done; he denied any death wishes or suicidal ideas. He was fully oriented, had an excellent fund of information, and could do calculations quickly. His recent and remote",
    "speech was clear, coherent, relevant, and spontaneous. When he talked spontaneously, it was largely to discuss his concerns about getting his thesis done; he denied any death wishes or suicidal ideas. He was fully oriented, had an excellent fund of information, and could do calculations quickly. His recent and remote memory were unimpaired; his insight and judgment seemed excel - lent: \u201cLife is too meaningful, and I\u2019m wasting it.\u201d Evaluation of Jeremy Dowling In evaluating any mood disorder, the first business at hand is to determine whether either a major depressive episode or a manic episode has been present. Jeremy came close to satisfying criteria for the former: He had been \u201csomewhat depressed\u201d for a long time, perhaps most of his adult life. The depression was present most of the time, and he never took much pleasure in things; He felt chronically guilty and had poor con - centration and low self- esteem. However, from history and direct observation he had had no problems with appetite or weight, suicidal ideas, or level of psychomotor activ- ity. Although he did complain of fatigue, this symptom appeared related to his coffee Jeremy Dowling 627 drinking. His family history was strongly positive for a mood disorder (his mother had been depressed, and two relatives had committed suicide). Jeremy had four symptoms (five required) of major depressive episode, and two symptoms (two required) of persistent depressive disorder, or dysthymia for short. So we have to ask: Is it reasonable to insist that a patient exactly fulfill the criteria? After all, Jeremy nearly met criteria for major depressive episode, and his family history was strongly positive. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder would point the way to treatment and alert clinicians to possible worsening symptoms (such as suicidal ideas) later on. But this clinician felt that it was more important to emphasize the prolonged course of Jeremy\u2019s symptoms, which seemed almost to shade into his personality dis - order (see below). Dysthymia often sets the stage for later major depressive disorder, and the DSM-5 criteria have blended them anyway, by explicitly stating that even a full major depressive disorder can be diagnosed as a specifier to dysthymia. I wouldn\u2019t waste a lot of time in argument about this area\u2014where two excellent diagnosticians may disagree forever, and where you can see the benefits of judging a patient not on the basis of (obsessively) counting symptoms but",
    "full major depressive disorder can be diagnosed as a specifier to dysthymia. I wouldn\u2019t waste a lot of time in argument about this area\u2014where two excellent diagnosticians may disagree forever, and where you can see the benefits of judging a patient not on the basis of (obsessively) counting symptoms but matching to a prototype of an idealized patient. Let\u2019s go ahead and give him a diagnosis that will promote pos - sibly effective treatment. There\u2019s also the matter of Jeremy\u2019s anxiety symptoms. He had never had actual anxiety attacks, phobias, obsessions, or compulsions. But he\u2019d certainly been anxious, however. He worried about a variety of things\u2014school, his personality, the intensity of his relationship with his girlfriend. He complained of fatigue, troubles with his sleep, and concentration, which would seem (barely) enough to qualify for a diagnosis of gen- eralized anxiety disorder. However, these symptoms occurred during the course of a mood disorder, so his clinician felt that no concurrent anxiety diagnosis was needed. (He even failed to meet the criteria for the mood specifier with anxious distress ; see p. 159). Besides, his anxiety symptoms could be all bound up with his caffeinism, so I\u2019d not add this extra dollop of diagnostic verbiage. As for substance use, although Jeremy had never used alcohol or street drugs, his coffee use had on many occasions produced nervousness, upset stomach, palpitations, muscle twitching, and insomnia. These were sometimes serious enough that he couldn\u2019t go to school; the symptoms would qualify for a diagnosis of caffeine intoxication . You might wonder about a diagnosis of caffeine use disorder, but this is one that isn\u2019t sanc- tioned by DSM-5. His usage does make one wonder, though. Finally, self- described as a perfectionistic pessimist who chronically felt he was not good enough, Jeremy was also a maker of lists and a straightener of drawers who had trouble making decisions and couldn\u2019t discard things. These features, plus his mor- alistic condemnation of his father, would be diagnostic of obsessive\u2013 compulsive per- sonality disorder. Jeremy\u2019s dysthymia appeared to have begun years ago, probably when he was still a teenager. His hypersomnia and increased appetite would qualify him for the specifier with atypical features (p. 160), were it not for the fact that I couldn\u2019t find any evidence 628 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES of mood reactivity in the vignette.

She walked at 18 months, spoke words at 2 years, and formed sentences at 3. She was a withdrawn, frightened child who had clung so tightly to her mother that she could not even be left with a babysitter. She didn\u2019t begin school until she was nearly 7. With an IQ that hovered in the low 70s, she attended special classes for her first 2 years and was then mainstreamed. In her early school years, Cookie developed a reputation for biting and kicking other children. When she was 11, she was repeatedly disciplined for stealing (and eat - ing) lunches belonging to other children. At about the same time, she began to pull out her hair. She would usually pull only a few strands at a time from the front of her head, but worked away at it assiduously throughout the day. By the end of the school day, there would be little accumulations of hair all around her desk. However, it was Cookie\u2019s persistent tendency to hurt and mutilate herself that first brought her into mental health care. At 9, she bit her lip until it bled.

    "it was Cookie\u2019s persistent tendency to hurt and mutilate herself that first brought her into mental health care. At 9, she bit her lip until it bled. The following year, she gradually fell into the habit of repeatedly banging her forearms on the edge of a table; this produced chronic swelling and bruising, and eventually a constantly running sore. When she was 13, she cut long troughs in her face with a razor and then rubbed dirt into the wounds, producing permanent, hypertrophic scars. Several of these episodes prompted admission to mental health facilities. Most of them were for short stays, but once, when she was 16 and had set fire to her pantyhose, she was kept for 4 months. During this admission it was learned that from the age of 7, Cookie had been sexually molested almost weekly by her father and two older brothers. She was subsequently admitted to the first in a series of group homes for persons with developmental disabilities. Cookie\u2019s pattern in each of these facilities was to form an immediate, strong rela - Cookie Coates 629 tionship with one or more staff members, especially males. Typically, she would call one of them \u201cDaddy.\u201d When a staff member disappointed her (as each inevitably did), she would say that she hated that staffer. Her animosity could last for weeks, during which she would sometimes sulk and say she was depressed, and sometimes lose her temper and throw things in her room. At still other times she would accuse her coun - selors of conspiring to drive her crazy, so they could return her to the hospital. As she became more familiar with a facility, she would request special privileges (extra food at supper, staying up late) and injure herself in some dramatic way when these were not forthcoming. Gradually, Cookie began to act out sexually. During parties or other activities with patients from the men\u2019s group home, she would lie with her head in the lap of nearly any male patient or run her hand between his thighs. Repeated cautioning and coun - seling from her own staff counselors did nothing to eliminate this sort of behavior; she only became more cautious about where and when she did it. Also in the various group homes, she was found to eat in binges. Habitually a big eater, now she also ate from the plates of others when",
    "own staff counselors did nothing to eliminate this sort of behavior; she only became more cautious about where and when she did it. Also in the various group homes, she was found to eat in binges. Habitually a big eater, now she also ate from the plates of others when they were finished; often she volunteered to clear away the table, even when it was not her turn. None of the staffers who provided information to the admitting clinician was aware of any self- induced vomiting or use of laxatives. And they described her usual activity level as \u201ccouch potato.\u201d On admission to the unit, Cookie was an obese woman who wore no makeup and was dressed in a sweatshirt and sweatpants. She fiddled with strands of her hair; although she did not pull any out during the interview, her scalp bore half- dollar-sized patches of near- baldness. She denied feeling a sense of either tension or relief in regard to her hair pulling, and she didn\u2019t show any evidence of distress about it. She sat quietly, showing no evidence of abnormal movements, and cooperated with the examiner. She said that she felt \u201chopeless\u201d; her somewhat flattened mood was generally appropriate to these thoughts. She spoke slowly and did not volunteer information, but she always responded to questions. Her thinking was sequential and goal- oriented, with no evi - dence of loose associations. Cookie reported occasionally seeing \u201cshowers of spiders\u201d falling from the ventila - tor in the ceiling of her bedroom. For several years she had intermittently heard voices directing her to harm herself. She usually noticed them when she was unhappy. They were quite clearly audible, were not the voices of anyone she knew, and were located within her own head. Upon close questioning, she agreed that they could be her own thoughts. She did not think anyone else could hear them. She talked freely about the sexual abuse she had suffered from her father and brothers, and described it in graphic (and seemingly accurate) detail. However, she offered no evidence of either reliving or repressing these experiences. Cookie scored 28 out of 30 on the MMSE (she could remember only two of three objects at 5 minutes, and she missed the correct date by several days).

    "Cookie scored 28 out of 30 on the MMSE (she could remember only two of three objects at 5 minutes, and she missed the correct date by several days). Although she maintained good attention, she could only perform very simple calculations.

She did not feel that she needed to be in the hospital, and said that she would like to get her own apartment and a job as a waitress. Evaluation of Cookie Coates Cookie presented with a wide variety of clinical problems and symptoms, potentially encompassing psychotic, mood, anxiety, impulse- control, eating, and personality disor- ders, as well as low intellectual functioning. Let\u2019s consider the last factor first. Slow to develop, Cookie consistently had IQ scores that were in the low 70s. She performed well on the MMSE and had no prob - lems with attention, so she would not seem to qualify for delirium or a major or minor neurocognitive disorder. Her clinician felt that the extent of her deficits (problems with self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, self- direction, and safety) warranted a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability. Cookie also reported feeling hopeless and depressed, but these symptoms appeared to be transitory, reactive to her circumstances, and to some extent manipula- tive. Symptoms of psychosis (seeing spiders, hearing voices) did not carry the convic - tion of true hallucinations: They often occurred when she was unhappy (principle K), and she noted that the voices could be her own thoughts. She had no loose associa - tions, catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms typical of schizophrenia. In fact, no diagnosis of psychosis seemed justified. Although she had abnormal eating behavior , she didn\u2019t appear distressed about it, and she had no history of vomiting or use of laxa- tives or diuretics; her self- evaluation did not overemphasize her weight or body shape. One clinician who reviewed the case felt that her history had some of the features of posttraumatic stress disorder, but she had no history of reliving the sexual abuse she had endured as a child. Cookie\u2019s acting out included biting, kicking, hair pulling, and stealing, which began when she was about 11. These behaviors did not appear",
    "that her history had some of the features of posttraumatic stress disorder, but she had no history of reliving the sexual abuse she had endured as a child. Cookie\u2019s acting out included biting, kicking, hair pulling, and stealing, which began when she was about 11. These behaviors did not appear to be part of a larger problem with violating societal norms or the rights of others, ruling out conduct dis - order. The hair pulling was not associated with stress, and there was no information that she\u2019d tried to stop it, so we wouldn\u2019t diagnose trichotillomania. Self- injury can be encountered in stereotypic movement disorder, but Cookie\u2019s behavior did not appear to be repetitive and stereotypical. As a small child, she might have qualified for a diag- nosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder (because of the excessive readiness to approach strangers), but we don\u2019t have information enough for the diagnosis even in retrospect, and it wouldn\u2019t appear to be a problem now. And so, having ruled out major mental disorders as the cause of these behaviors, we can now consider a personality disorder (principle W). Indeed, most of her self- destructive behaviors seemed well explained by borderline personality disorder . Beginning in her teens and affecting many life areas, the relevant symptoms included self-harm, intense interpersonal relations (those with various staff members), impulsiv- ity (eating, sexual acting out), reactive mood (temper tantrums), and paranoid ideation. Although Cookie by no means had every symptom of borderline personality disor- Cookie Coates 631 der, those she did report I\u2019d call severe. Her GAF score of 30 would reflect a composite of all her difficulties.

They bothered him every day, and he wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could stand it. Dean was 54, but he had first heard voices when he was only in his early 40s. In fact, he had been hos - pitalized on three separate occasions; each time he had been successfully treated with medication. It had now been over 6 years since he was last hospitalized. \u201cThey\u2019re in my head, but they sound just as loud and clear as a radio,\u201d Dean said.

    "treated with medication. It had now been over 6 years since he was last hospitalized. \u201cThey\u2019re in my head, but they sound just as loud and clear as a radio,\u201d Dean said. The voices were mostly men, but there were a few women as well; none of them were at all familiar. They spoke only phrases, not sentences, but they tried to order him around. They\u2019d tell him it was time to go home or that it would be OK to have another drink. \u201cMostly they seemed to be looking out for me.\u201d He thought they\u2019d been talking for about 3 weeks this time. Dean admitted that he was a drinker. He had begun drinking sweet wine when he was only 12. In the military he had had a few fights and was even threatened with court- martial once, but he\u2019d managed to \u201cescape with an honorable discharge.\u201d Over the years, he\u2019d been arrested several times for driving while under the influence of alcohol; the most recent time was only 2 weeks ago. Dean\u2019s usual pattern was to drink heavily for several months, then stop suddenly and stay dry for years. His three previous benders had occurred 3, 5, and 11 years earlier. It was during the bender of 11 years ago that his wife walked out on him for good; she was tired of paying his traffic tickets and supporting him when he got fired for missing work. But he had a girlfriend then, Annie\u2014the same woman he was with now\u2014so he didn\u2019t mind so much about his wife. What he remembered most vividly was the time he\u2019d heard voices for nearly 3 months. \u201cIt was enough to drive a man to drink,\u201d he commented, without a trace of irony. On the present occasion, it was the IRS that had supplied the drive. He made good money at his trade (he was a meat cutter), and, apparently while he was in the coils of his last bender 3 years earlier, he had neglected to report some of it. Now he was being dunned for back taxes, interest, and penalties, and he didn\u2019t even have any records. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to start drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI only meant to take a drink.\u201d Now he had been drinking over a quart of bourbon a day for 2 months.

Annie added that he \u201cnever seemed drunk,\u201d and she confirmed that he only had these hallucinations after he\u2019d been drinking for a while. The middle of three children, Dean had been born in Chicago, where his father worked as a meat salesman. His parents had divorced when he was 9; his mother had 632 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES remarried twice. In the course of a depression 4 years earlier, his older brother had shot and killed himself. His sister was a nurse who had once been hospitalized for abusing barbiturates. After the military, Dean had attended 2 years of junior college, but he didn\u2019t think it ever did him much good. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anything more than a big, dumb city slicker who cuts up dead animals for a living,\u201d he said. Annie reported that Dean had been depressed most of the time for the last month and a half\u2014not quite as long as he\u2019d been drinking. He had cried some and slept poorly, often awakening early in the morning, unable to get back to sleep. His appetite had diminished, and he\u2019d lost about 20 pounds. He seemed chronically tired, and his sex interest was diminished except when he was drunk, which was most of the time. Dean looked closer to 60 than to 54. He had clearly lost weight. He was over 6 feet tall, but his outsized clothes seemed to diminish his size. He slumped quietly in his chair and only spoke when spoken to. His voice was a low monotone, but his speech was relevant and coherent. He was fully alert, and he paid close attention to the conversation. There was very little variation in his mood, which he admitted was depressed. He was fully oriented to time, place, and person; he scored 29 out of 30 on the MMSE, failing only to recall a street address after 5 minutes. He had never had delusions, but neither did he seem to have any insight into the fact that what he heard was not real. Dean had had some thoughts about dying. They had begun with the depression, and now the voices had jumped on the idea. \u201cThey aren\u2019t ordering me to",

To begin with, what were Dean\u2019s diagnosable drinking behaviors? Of course, he had a variety of the criteria for alcohol use disorder (p. 397): There were social symp- toms (divorce, arrests). During the current episode of drinking, he demonstrated tol - erance (he didn\u2019t appear drunk on a quart per day of hard liquor), continued to drink despite having hallucinations, and used more alcohol than he intended (\u201cI only meant to take a drink\u201d). Even if withdrawal symptoms were not taken into account, he would qualify for a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. He had been actively drinking within the past month, so he could have no course specifier. Dean\u2019s somatic complaints included appetite and weight loss, reduced libido, and insomnia. These represent three separate DSM-5 categories (eating, sleep\u2013wake, and sexual disorders), and a differential diagnosis could be constructed for each. However, the resulting burden of independent major mental diagnoses would be highly unlikely, from either a statistical or a logical viewpoint (principle M\u2014keep it simple). These somatic complaints can all be found in patients who have depression, psychosis, or alcohol- related disorders. A mood disorder due to another medical condition must always be considered, especially in a patient who has been ignoring health needs (prin- Dean Wannamaker 633 ciple B). Although we\u2019d need a physical examination and laboratory tests to be certain, no information given in the vignette suggests that Dean had any such medical disorder. Throughout his later adult life, Dean had intermittently heard voices. A principal concern for any psychotic patient is whether schizophrenia is a possibility. But Dean lacked the A portion of the basic criteria\u2014he heard voices, but that was the only psy - chotic symptom he had\u2014 knocking out schizophrenia , as well as schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders.

    "criteria\u2014he heard voices, but that was the only psy - chotic symptom he had\u2014 knocking out schizophrenia , as well as schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders. He had hallucinations but no other symptoms (OK, his affect was constricted, but I\u2019d chalk that up to the depression). Annie pointed out that he only developed hallucinations subsequent to drinking. The results of his MMSE would rule out delirium and a major or mild neurocognitive disorder ; the history would exclude psychotic disorder due to another medical condition . Of course, all other psychotic disorders require that the symptoms not be directly related to the use of a substance. Furthermore, neither delusional disorder nor brief psychotic disorder can be diagnosed if a mood disorder is a more likely etiology. Look at the criteria for substance/medication- induced psychotic disorder in Chapter 2 (p. 93). These require prominent hallucinations or delusions (or disorganized speech). Inasmuch as Dean always drank before the hallucinations appeared, and they never lasted longer than a few weeks after the drinking stopped, he would seem to fulfill the criteria for alcohol- induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations. If this became the working diagnosis, we\u2019d add the qualifier with onset during withdrawal . As for mood disorder, Dean fulfilled the inclusion criteria for major depressive episode: He had had more than 2 weeks of persistent low mood, fatigue, weight loss, insomnia, and thoughts of suicide. His symptoms weren\u2019t due to a medical condition, represented a change from his usual self, and certainly distressed him. However, they did occur subsequent to the time he began drinking, and therefore could be alcohol- related; if so, this would rule out major depressive disorder. The criteria for substance- induced mood disorder are simple, and Dean would appear to fulfill them: He was persistently depressed, meeting full criteria for a major depressive disorder; he had also been drinking for several months, and we know that alcohol is fully capable of inducing severe depression. DSM-5 mentions several bits of evidence that would support a non- substance- related depression. Although his brother had shot himself during a depression, we do not know whether he was also a drinker; a sister had used drugs. OK, genetic information isn\u2019t a criterion, but it is a useful prin- ciple (B). Major depressive disorder is treatable, and it can be lethal. It should be given a high priority for investigation and possible treatment (principle F).",
    "know whether he was also a drinker; a sister had used drugs. OK, genetic information isn\u2019t a criterion, but it is a useful prin- ciple (B). Major depressive disorder is treatable, and it can be lethal. It should be given a high priority for investigation and possible treatment (principle F). However, it should not be diagnosed automatically in a substance-using patient; many instances of mood disorder will improve when the patient stops using the substance. Therefore, symptoms of substance use, mood disorder, and psychosis must be accounted for in Dean\u2019s final diagnosis. It would not appear that cognitive or general medical conditions can explain these symptoms (principle C). It would be elegant to explain all of them simply, on the basis of one underlying disease mechanism (principle M). Because substance use was surely the first of these symptom groups to appear (prin- 634 PATIENTS AND DIAGNOSES ciple X)\u2014Dean began drinking at age 12 and had some behavioral problems resulting from it when he was a young man in the military\u2014it is reasonable to consider it first. Now we have two ways of looking at Dean\u2019s symptoms: (1) Alcohol usage induced a psychosis, and he had an independent major depressive disorder; or (2) alcohol usage induced both a psychosis and a mood disorder. The simplicity of the second formula - tion, plus the desire not to rush in with possibly unnecessary treatment before it is needed, would lead a conservative clinician initially to regard the mood disorder as substance- induced\u2014at least until Dean could be withdrawn completely from alcohol. Under ICD-9, the clinician\u2019s perception that the alcoholism was the underlying prob - lem, and thus the one that should be addressed first, would determine the order in which we list the diagnoses. Under ICD-10, where we code the use disorder at the same time as the psychosis or depression, I\u2019d list the psychosis first; it seems to require treatment more urgently.

    "F10.24 [303.90, 291.89] Alcohol- induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication Dean Wannamaker 635 637 APPENDIX Essential Tables Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) As you will note, you have to get fairly far down the list (around 50\u201370) to arrive at a point at which most patients described in this book were awarded a diagnosis. Although we can interpo- late between these numbers, trying to interpolate at a finer degree than 5-unit intervals (65, 25, etc.) is probably futile. As you will notice, that hasn\u2019t stopped me from trying on some occasions, however. 638 Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale Consider psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health- illness. Do not include impairment in functioning due to physical (or environmental) limitations. Code (Note: Use intermediate codes when appropriate, e.g., 45, 68, 72.) 100 | 91 Superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life\u2019s problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. No symptoms. 90 | 81 Absent or minimal symptoms (e.g., mild anxiety before an exam ), good functioning in all areas, interested and involved in a wide range of activities. socially effective, generally satisfied with life, no more than everyday problems or concerns (e.g. an occasional argu - ment with family members). 80 | 71 If symptoms are present, they are transient and expectable reactions to psychosocial stress- ors (e.g., difficulty concentrating after family argument); no more than slight impairment in social, occupational or school functioning (e.g., temporarily falling behind in schoolwork). 70 | 61 Some mild symptoms (e.g., depressed mood and mild insomnia) OR some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., occasional truancy, or theft within the household), but generally functioning pretty well, has some meaningful interpersonal relationships. 60 | 51 Moderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) OR moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., few friends, con- flicts with peers or co- workers). 50 | 41 Serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job). 40 | 31 Some impairment in reality testing or communication (e.g., speech is at times illogical, obscure, or irrelevant) OR major impairment in several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or",

    "Administration and Scoring of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) PAR Staff 2 ChecKIT Series GAD-7 Figure 1. GAD-7 Score Report Figure Example None to minimal 0 5 10 15 20 Mild Moderate Severe OVERVIEW The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; 2006) scale was developed by Robert L. Spitzer, Kurt Kroenke, Janet B. W. Williams, and Bernd L\u00f6we based on the diagnostic criteria for gen- eralized anxiety disorder (GAD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The measure was originally composed of 13 items, but only the 7 items with the highest correlations were included in the final instrument. Since its inception, the GAD-7 has become increasingly popular in research (Dear et al., 2011) and clinical practice (Beard and Bj\u00f6rgvinsson, 2014). Administration and scoring, available on PARiConnect, take approxi- mately 2 minutes. ADMINISTRATION The GAD-7 is administered using PARiConnect, PAR\u2019s online assessment platform. Examinees can complete the GAD-7 in-office or at a remote location via an email link, which launches the administration. Detailed information on the use of PARiConnect is available under All Help Topics in PARiConnect. Each of the 7 items are displayed one at a time with a progress bar displayed below the response options. Items cannot be skipped during administration. Therefore, an advantage to administering the GAD-7 via PARiConnect is the ability to capture a complete administration each and every time. GAD-7 items reflect the DSM-IV criteria for GAD. Respondents are asked to rate each item for frequency of occurrence using a 4-point Likert scale (Not at all = 0, Several days = 1, More than half the days = 2, and Nearly every day = 3). SCORING All responses are summed to calculate the total GAD-7 score. Scores range from 0\u201321 with increasing scores indicating greater severity of symptoms of anxiety. GAD-7 Score Report Severity Ranges After generating a Score Report on PARiConnect, an examinee\u2019s GAD-7 score will be plotted along a number line with shading to represent changes in severity of symptoms of anxiety (see Figure 1). Severity ranges are based on guidance in the initial validation study by Kroenke and colleagues (2006). 3 ChecKIT Series GAD-7 Cut-off Recommendations In the extant literature, several recommended cut-off scores have been suggested. Kroenke et al. (2007) found mean GAD-7 scores were 14.0, 12.5, 13.0, 12.0 for GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder, respectively, compared to 3.0",
    "by Kroenke and colleagues (2006). 3 ChecKIT Series GAD-7 Cut-off Recommendations In the extant literature, several recommended cut-off scores have been suggested. Kroenke et al. (2007) found mean GAD-7 scores were 14.0, 12.5, 13.0, 12.0 for GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder, respectively, compared to 3.0 for individuals with no anxiety disorder. They also examined the sensitivity, specificity, and pos- itive likelihood ratios for GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and any anxiety disorder using GAD-7 cut-off scores ranging from \u22655 to \u226510. They noted the sensitivity and specificity approached or exceeded 75% for all disorders and the positive likelihood ratio exceeded 3.0 when using a cut-off score of 8 or greater. Based on a recent meta-analysis, Plummer et al. (2016) recommended using a cut-off of 8 or higher to optimize sensitivity without compromising specificity. Table 1 shows the sensitivity, speci- ficity, and positive likelihood ratios of the afore- mentioned diagnoses using a cut-off score of 8 or higher (Kroenke et al., 2007). Treatment Recommendations The GAD-7 Score Report includes treatment recommendations based on an individual\u2019s score. These proposed treatment actions, shown in Table 2, are based on recommendations by Spitzer et al. (2006). Individuals with a score of 8 or higher are considered likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety or related disorder.

Repeat administration of the GAD-7 every 4 weeks to monitor symptoms.

    "oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and anxiety/ depression. (The initial teacher scale also screens for learning disabilities.) These are screened by the number of positive responses in each of the segments. The specific item sets and numbers of positives required for each comorbid symptom screen set are detailed below and on the next page. The second section of the scale has a set of performance measures, scored 1 to 5, with 4 and 5 being somewhat of a problem/ problematic. To meet criteria for ADHD there must be at least 2 items of the performance set in which the child scores a 4, or 1 item of the performance set in which the child scores a 5; ie, there must be impairment, not just symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria. The sheet has a place to record the number of positives (4s, 5s). Scoring to Monitor Symptom and Performance Improvement For the purposes of tracking symptoms and symptom severity, calculate the mean response for each subsegment of the ADHD symptom assessment screen items (inattentive 9 and hyperactive 9). To calculate the mean responses, first total the responses (0s, 1s, 2s, and 3s) from each item within the inattentive subsegment (items 1\u2013 \u20139) and divide by the number of items that received a response. For example, if a parent only provided responses to 7 of the first 9 items, the responses would be totaled and divided by 7. Follow the same calculation instructions for the hyperactive subsegment (items 10\u2013 \u201318). Baseline Assessment The validation studies for the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales were for the 6\u2013 to 12-year-old age group. However, to the extent that they collect information to establish Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, they are applicable to other groups, particularly preschoolers, where they have identified that DSM-5 criteria are still appropriate. These scales should not be used alone to make a diagnosis of ADHD without confirming and elaborating the information with interviews with at least the primary caregivers (usually parents) and patients. You must take into consideration information from multiple sources. Scores of 2 or 3 on a single symptom question reflect often-occurring behaviors. Scores of 4 or 5 on performance questions reflect problems in performance. The initial assessment scales, parent and teacher, have 2 components: symptom assessment and impairment in performance. On both parent and teacher initial scales, the symptom assessment screens for symptoms that",

On both parent and teacher initial scales, the symptom assessment screens for symptoms that meet criteria for inattentive (items 1\u2013 \u20139) and hyperactive (items 10\u2013 \u201318) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Scoring for Diagnostic Purposes To meet DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis, one must have at least 6 positive responses to the inattentive 9 or hyperactive 9 core symptoms, or both. A positive response is a 2 or 3 (often, very often) (you could draw a line straight down the page and count the positive answers in each subsegment). There is a place to record the number of positives in each subsegment.
