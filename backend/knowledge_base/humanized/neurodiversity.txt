Neurodiversity just means that differences in how our brains work—like deep focus, sensory sensitivity, or different ways of socializing—are natural.
It’s not about something being "wrong" with you; it’s about having a brain that processes the world differently.
Many autistic or ADHD individuals find they have unique strengths, like vivid creativity, strong empathy, or an ability to see patterns others miss.
Often, the struggle comes from trying to force a unique brain into a standard mold.
Understanding your own patterns is the first step to building a life that actually fits you.
