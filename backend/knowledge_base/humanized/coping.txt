When you notice sensory overload or feeling scattered, simple changes can really help.
Breaking big tasks into tiny, manageable steps is a great way to reduce that feeling of pressure.
Sometimes, just adjusting your meaningful environment—like lowering lights or reducing noise—can give your brain the break it needs.

For emotional regulation, movement is surprisingly powerful. Even a short walk or some stretching can shift your state.
Mindfulness isn't about emptying your mind, but just pausing to notice where you are right now.
And remember, you don't have to do this alone—connecting with people who "get it" can make a world of difference.
