Stress often shows up when demands feel bigger than our capacity to handle them.
Some people feel it physically—in their chest, stomach, or sleep patterns.
Others notice it in their mind—racing thoughts, irritability, or just feeling "on edge" all the time.
It's your body's way of saying, "I'm protecting you," even if it feels overwhelming.

Anxiety isn't just "worrying too much." It can feel like a persistent alarm bell that won't turn off.
It might show up as restlessness, fatigue, or finding it really hard to focus on anything else.
If you find yourself avoiding things you usually do because of this fear, that's a common sign of anxiety.

Depression is different from just being sad. It can feel like the color has drained out of life.
You might notice changes in your sleep or appetite, or just a heavy lack of energy.
It keeps you from seeing your own worth. It’s not laziness; it’s a heavy weight you’re carrying.
