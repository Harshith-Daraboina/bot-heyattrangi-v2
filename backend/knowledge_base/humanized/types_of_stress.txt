Work stress often feels like a never-ending to-do list where you never feel "done."
You might feel undervalued, constantly rushed, or like you have to be "on" all the time.
It shows up as dreading Mondays or feeling too drained to do anything after work.
Burnout is different—it’s like the battery is completely dead. You might feel cynical, detached, or like nothing you do matters anymore.

Social stress can come from feeling judged, or feeling like you have to perform a certain version of yourself.
It might make you withdraw, replay conversations in your head, or feel lonely even when you’re with others.

Chronic stress is the "background noise" kind—where you've been in survival mode for so long you don't remember what relaxing feels like.
It often shows up as physical aches, gut issues, or being easily startled.

Trauma-linked stress feels deeper. It might not be about what's happening *now*, but your body reacting to the past.
It can feel like sudden panic, checking exits, or shutting down completely when things get loud or chaotic.
