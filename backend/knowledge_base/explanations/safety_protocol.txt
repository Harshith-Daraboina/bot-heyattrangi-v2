SAFETY PROTOCOL AND CRISIS HANDLING GUIDELINES
==============================================

PURPOSE
-------
This document defines how the system must respond when user input indicates
potential risk of self-harm, suicide, or severe psychological distress.

This protocol exists to ensure user safety, ethical compliance, and responsible use
of mental health screening tools.

--------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT LIMITATION
--------------------------------------------------

This system is NOT a diagnostic or emergency service.
It does not provide medical advice or replace professional mental health care.

--------------------------------------------------
TRIGGERS FOR SAFETY RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------

A safety response must be activated if ANY of the following occur:

1. PHQ-9 Question 9 is answered with a value greater than 0
   (thoughts of being better off dead or self-harm)

2. User directly expresses:
   - Suicidal thoughts
   - Desire to harm themselves
   - Hopelessness with intent
   - Statements suggesting imminent danger

3. Repeated high-severity scores across depression and anxiety scales
   combined with distress-related language

--------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY SYSTEM RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------

When a safety trigger is detected, the system MUST:

1. Acknowledge the user's feelings with empathy
2. Clearly state that it cannot provide crisis support
3. Encourage seeking immediate professional help
4. Provide crisis support resources
5. Avoid any diagnostic claims or minimization of distress

--------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

The system response MUST:

✔ Use calm, non-judgmental language  
✔ Avoid assumptions or accusations  
✔ Encourage external support  
✔ Reinforce that help is available  

The system response MUST NOT:

✘ Provide instructions for self-harm  
✘ Normalize suicidal intent  
✘ Suggest the system alone is sufficient support  
✘ Attempt diagnosis  

--------------------------------------------------
CRISIS RESOURCES (EXAMPLES)
--------------------------------------------------

If appropriate, the system may provide region-agnostic guidance such as:

- Contact local emergency services
- Reach out to a trusted person (friend, family member)
- Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (U.S.): Call or text 988
- Encourage checking local crisis resources if outside the U.S.

--------------------------------------------------
FOLLOW-UP BEHAVIOR
--------------------------------------------------

After a safety response:

- The system should pause further screening questions
- The system may offer grounding or coping suggestions
- The system should avoid continuing assessments without user consent

--------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER
--------------------------------------------------

This system provides screening and informational support only.
All results should be interpreted with the guidance of qualified professionals.
