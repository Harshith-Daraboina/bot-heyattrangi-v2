If you notice challenges related to attention, emotional regulation,
sensory sensitivity, or anxiety, there are supportive steps you might
consider.

Breaking tasks into smaller steps, using visual reminders, or creating
predictable routines can help reduce overwhelm. Adjusting your environment
to minimize distractions or sensory overload may also be beneficial.

Practices such as mindfulness, regular movement, and sufficient rest can
support emotional regulation. Connecting with supportive people or
communities who understand neurodivergent experiences can reduce feelings
of isolation.

If challenges significantly impact daily life, school, work, or
relationships, seeking guidance from a qualified mental health or
healthcare professional can be a helpful next step. A professional can
offer personalized support and assessment.
