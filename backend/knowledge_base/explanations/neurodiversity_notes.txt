Neurodiversity refers to the natural variation in how human brains
process information, experience emotions, and interact with the world.
Differences in attention, sensory processing, communication, or emotional
regulation are part of normal human diversity.

Neurodivergent traits can present both challenges and strengths.
Difficulties often arise not because something is "wrong" with a person,
but because environments are not designed to support different thinking
styles.

Many people with neurodivergent traits develop creativity, deep focus on
interests, strong empathy, pattern recognition, or innovative problem-
solving abilities. Support, understanding, and appropriate accommodations
can make a significant difference in daily functioning.

Screening tools are meant to support self-understanding and guide next
steps. They are not judgments, diagnoses, or measures of worth.
