DSM-5-TR CLINICAL REFERENCE (SUMMARY)
------------------------------------

IMPORTANT:
This content summarizes DSM-5-TR diagnostic frameworks for educational and screening purposes only.
It is not a diagnostic tool and should not replace professional evaluation.

--------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION-DEFICIT / HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)
--------------------------------------------------

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or
hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development.

CORE SYMPTOM DOMAINS:
1. Inattention:
   - Difficulty sustaining attention
   - Careless mistakes
   - Difficulty organizing tasks
   - Forgetfulness
   - Easily distracted

2. Hyperactivity / Impulsivity:
   - Excessive movement or fidgeting
   - Difficulty remaining seated
   - Talking excessively
   - Interrupting others
   - Difficulty waiting turn

DSM-5-TR CRITERIA SUMMARY:
- Several symptoms must be present before age 12
- Symptoms must be present in two or more settings (e.g., home and school/work)
- Symptoms must cause clear functional impairment
- Symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder

SUBTYPES:
- Predominantly Inattentive Presentation
- Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation
- Combined Presentation

--------------------------------------------------
ANXIETY DISORDERS (GENERALIZED ANXIETY FOCUS)
--------------------------------------------------

Anxiety disorders involve excessive fear, worry, or avoidance behaviors that are disproportionate
to actual threat and interfere with daily functioning.

GENERALIZED ANXIETY FEATURES:
- Excessive worry occurring more days than not
- Difficulty controlling worry
- Associated symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance
- Worry is persistent and difficult to dismiss

IMPAIRMENT:
- Anxiety must cause distress or interfere with social, occupational, or daily functioning

--------------------------------------------------
DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS
--------------------------------------------------

Depressive disorders involve persistent disturbances in mood, motivation, and cognitive functioning.

CORE FEATURES:
- Persistent low mood or loss of interest/pleasure
- Changes in sleep, appetite, or energy
- Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
- Difficulty concentrating
- Psychomotor changes
- Thoughts of death or self-harm

DURATION:
- Symptoms typically persist for at least two weeks

SEVERITY:
- Severity is determined by symptom count, intensity, and level of functional impairment

IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE:
- Any expression of suicidal thoughts requires immediate professional support

--------------------------------------------------
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD)
--------------------------------------------------

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social
communication and restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.

CORE DOMAINS:
1. Social Communication and Interaction:
   - Differences in social reciprocity
   - Difficulty interpreting social cues
   - Differences in nonverbal communication
   - Challenges developing or maintaining relationships

2. Restricted and Repetitive Patterns:
   - Repetitive behaviors or speech
   - Strong preference for routines
   - Intense or focused interests
   - Sensory sensitivities

DEVELOPMENTAL CONTEXT:
- Traits are typically present from early development
- Presentation varies widely across individuals

NEURODIVERSITY NOTE:
- Autism represents a natural variation in human neurodevelopment
- Traits may be associated with both challenges and strengths
- Support needs vary by individual and environment

--------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CLINICAL NOTES
--------------------------------------------------

- Screening tools identify patterns of traits or symptoms, not diagnoses
- Diagnosis requires comprehensive evaluation by qualified professionals
- Cultural, developmental, and contextual factors must be considered
- Comorbidity between conditions is common (e.g., ADHD and anxiety)



### Summary of DSM-5-TR Content and Structure

The **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR)**, published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2022, represents a comprehensive update to DSM-5 (2013) integrating **scientific advances, previous online updates, and text clarifications**. It emphasizes clinical utility, cultural competence, and incorporates a dimensional approach alongside the traditional categorical classification.

---

### Key Features and Organizational Principles

- **DSM-5-TR** includes **updated diagnostic criteria** for over 70 disorders, with **new diagnoses** such as **prolonged grief disorder** and symptom codes for suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior.
- The manual aligns with the **ICD-10-CM coding system** for diagnostic consistency and facilitates international harmonization, though full criteria harmonization with ICD-11 is *ongoing*.
- Disorders are organized developmentally, beginning with those manifesting early in life (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders) and concluding with disorders prevalent in later adulthood (e.g., neurocognitive disorders).
- The manual integrates **cultural, sex- and gender-related diagnostic issues**, and for the first time, a **Work Group on Ethnoracial Equity and Inclusion** reviewed the text to ensure nonstigmatizing language and attention to systemic factors like racism.
- **Dimensional and categorical approaches** coexist: DSM-5-TR remains primarily categorical, but it includes **dimensional measures** (e.g., symptom severity, cross-cutting symptom measures) to capture heterogeneity and subthreshold symptoms.

---

### Revision and Development Process

- DSM-5-TR is the product of a **multi-stage revision process**: original DSM-5 Task Force development (2013), iterative online updates overseen by the DSM Steering Committee, and the current text revision by a large Revision Subcommittee.
- The revision was supported by **extensive expert input** from over 200 field experts across disciplines and geographic locations.
- **DSM-5 field trials** tested reliability and clinical utility in diverse settings, leading to refinement of criteria and text.
